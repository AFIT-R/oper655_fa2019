We recently struck up a romantic relationship. And, um But we're kinda keeping it quiet for now. 'cause it's still kind of a new thing. It's a little delicate, And we just don't want all the drama. Exactly. 'cause when everyone knows-- Uh That's actually pretty funny, But in general, you know. Quiet. Hey, boss man. Yes? A bunch of us are going to get some drinks--you in? Ladies and gentlemen, it is quitting time. I'm sorry, I meant later. Okay. For happy hour? Yes, sure. No, I got that. Trying to get a head count. I am in. All right. Yes! It's a deal. It's a deal. Oh, hey, I invited my friend julie. Okay. I want her to meet michael. Why? They're both single. I have a sense they might-- You've been gone for a long time. It is not that. Kevin! Oh! Yeah! Hey, how are you? Oh, I missed you so much. Aww Yeah! Yeah. Waaaaah! Raaaaaaa! Waaaaaaa! When a new mom hears a baby cry, Her you-know-whats fill up with you know what, And then her shirt gets, you know That would be funny. Oh, wow, I cannot believe this is happening. This is everything I dreamed. Oh, my god! Easy. It's not a birthday. It's not a good-bye party. Oh, hey Pam and I are gonna go play pool With one of her friends, And we need a fourth. Sucks to be you. Would you like to be our fourth? That would be sublime. All right. So the guy shows me the deck he's built. And I'm like,  I'll call this a deck  if it'll make you happy, But this is just a porch without a roof.  It was ridiculous, man. It was like--you could maybe get two chairs on the thing. Two lawn chairs. Hey, michael. Yes. This is my friend julie. Hello. How are you? Good. Hi. What is a nice girl like you hanging out With these bums for? There you go. Julie laughs at everything. So you work with pam and jim? Oh, no, no. Pam and jim work for me. And if they win, they are fired. I should hope not. No. No, not really. Not really, But they better not win. Hey. Hey, isabel, you made it. Oh, my goodness. Of course. You want to play pool? Um I'm gonna do a lap. See if I know anyone. Okay. And then they said the most ridiculous thing About anderson cooper Uh-huh. Which I do not have the decency to repeat. But trust me when I tell you that-- Hold that thought. Well, well, well. If it isn't isabel. Mm-hmm. At's a girl like you doing in a place like this? A girl like me is why a guy like you comes To a place like this. Ooh, I love repartee. Do you? Usually means there's a battle scene coming. So what do you do? I am an esl teacher. Really? Yeah. See, I didn't think you could teach that. I thought that was something you were born with. What am I thinking right now? Are you thinking that I said  esp ? Yes. I feel like an idiot. Awesome. I was a little nervous when pam told me he was her boss, But he doesn't act like a boss at all. If I had a boss like that, we'd never get anything done. So what do you think? About what? About julie. She's nice. Yeah. Yeah. So you like her? Uh, yeah, sure. So pam was right. About what? About you two hitting it off. Well, apparently michael scott is on a date. And that-- That, my friend, changes everything. My brother, good head, bad heart. Good head, but heart. I know.
