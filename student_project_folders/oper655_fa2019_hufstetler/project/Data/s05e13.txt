I just want to say for the Record, i did not kill anyone. Stanley was attacked by his own heart. And he should be released from the hospital And back in the office in a couple days. Did you shout,  fire! , causing a panic? Yes, i shouted,  fire!  I shouted many things.

This city Dwight. We are not mad, we are just disappointed. No, we are mad. Yes. We are.we are livid. But we are going to let this one slide. no, we're not. i am not a mind-reader, david. Look, this is a very serious offense. We have cause to fire you. Can you shove down? Instead Shove down, please. Instead, what i think we should do Is strip you of your title as safety officer. no. and we should take A part of his pay and donate it To the charity of your choice. Something that dwight doesn't like. Peta. Michael, you have to take Responsibility here. One of your employees had a heart attack. He could have died because of the Way you're allowing your office to run. Do you want that on your conscience? Do you? michael. you talking to me? Yeah. What? Well I guess we papered over that pretty nicely. It always amuses me when corporate Thinks they can make some big change With a 20-minute meeting In some fancy high-rise. What's the matter?You hungry? No, dwight, i am worried. A man's life is in my hands. Don't you worry about that. I got it covered. Okay? I am planning a bomb scare. That Should really get the blood pumping. That's not gonna happen. I'm tang over as safety man. What? You? yes. come on. i'm a smart guy. I'll figure it out. that's preposterous. no, i will. ??? Nobody should have to go to work thinking,  oh, this is the place That i might die today.  That's what a hospital is for. An office is for not dying. An office is a place to Live life to the fullest, to the max, to An office is a place where dreams come true. Don't excite him. Don't make him excitable. Welcome back, stanley. Thank you, michael. It's true. Around this office, in the past, i Have been a little abrupt with people. Not maybe. Yes or no. No way. Uh-uh. Are you from another planet? Boy, have you lost your mind? 'Cause i'll help you find it. Did i stutter? I'm done. Good-bye. But the doctor said if i can't find a new Way to relate more positively to my surroundings, I'm going to die. Andy. A throne for your highness. I'm not sitting in a wheelchair. No, no, no. No debate. You are going to sit in that wheelchair Until you are back on your feet. ??? A, b, c--okay? And that stands for airway, Breathing, and circulation. Okay, you know what? That Could be a lile confusing Because in sales, a, b, c Means  always be closing.  This is a farce.i should Be teaching this course. Shut it. Shut it. We found ourselves on the Less-prepared side of things When stanley had his When his heart went berserk. And i knew exactly what to do, But in a much moreeal sense, I had no idea what to do. So i thought we should Have a cpr training class. And course you can't get the practice dummy Unless the instructor comes along with it. Red cross, you know, racket. I can't keep doing this forever. It's been 20 seconds. Call it. Would you like to try next? Absolutely i would not. You know who i really think should go? Stanley. Oh, i don't know. That's not a good idea, Michael. He needs to rest. No rest for the sick. We are not always going to be there To coddle your heart back When it disappears to be working. What are you gonna do if you're by Yourself and your heart stops? I would die. And you're okay with that? I'm okay with the logic of it. Uh-uh. No, no, no. Come on. Get up. Let's do this. Yes, i had a heart attack. I would quit, but i'm too Old to find another job.

And they have no arms or legs. No, that's not part of it. Where are they? You know what? If we come across Somebody with no arms or legs, Do we bother resuscitating them? I mean, what kind of quality Of life do we have there? I would want to live with no legs. How about no arms? No arms or legs is basically how You exist right now, kevin. You don't do anything. All right, well, let's get back To it.'cause you're losing him. Okay, too fast. Everyone we need to pump at a Pace of 100 beats per minute. Okay, that's, uh, hard to keep track.

Now, up ahead, a castle in the distance. Don't open your eyes. What? Ohh. And you walk up toward the castle, And inside the castle are four men. And each of them-- none Of them have shoes. And they give you a funny cigarette, And you feel even more relaxed. And then you want ice cream. You want a big bowl of ice cream. So what kind of ice cream do you want? Yell it out. Chunky monkey. too expensive. chocolate. Racism is dead,stanley. You can have any kind Of ice cream you want. What do you want? What is that? People. Please,i told you to get Rid of the cell phones.

I think that thing is on the fritz. Oscar. Would you reach over And touch his thing? That's what he said. Right,guys? 'Cause of gay. Let's give this a shot. Hello-- Michael,i think you're what's Stressing everybody out. So it wasn't dwight after all. Looks like i am the killer. You never expect that you're the killer. It's a great twist. Great twist. Dunder mifflin,this is pam. Oh. Hey,mom. No. What did dad say? What did you say to mdad? What? After you talked,he called my mom And said he was gonna Look for an apartment. Oh,my god. Pam,i don't kno I--nothing. Truly,nothing. I mean,i--i just was honest With him and i-- I'm so sorry,i--i don't know. I'll call him again. So It was her parents or my parents. What could jim have said To make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in our marriage Is he gonna say it to me? I don't get it. Do i stress you out? Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the Approval of mynferiors. Speaking of which-- Remember when people used to say  boss  When they were describing Something that was really cool? Like  those shoulder pads Are really boss,man.   look at that perm. That perm is so boss.  It's what made me want To become a boss. And i looked so good in A perm and shoulder pads. But now,boss is just slang Fo jerk in charge.  Okay,everybody. I figured it out. The reason that you are all So stressed around me Is that you are too Intimidated to tell me What you really think. You are keeping these feelings inside, And that is causing stress. So what is a solution? Solution is honesty, Laughter,and comedy. In short-- A vacation. It--what? No.no, I am talking about a roast!

Can i take a message? Great. I will. Thanks. It's very unusual for michael Not to show up to work. My guess-- he's either deeply depressed Or an icicle has snapped off His roof and impaled his brain. He has this terrible habit Of standing directly underneath them And staring up at them. And i always say, michael, Ta two steps back And stare at the icicle from the side.  And he's like, no,i Like the way they look From standing directly Underneath them.  It was only a matter of time. Michael is so dumb That he tries to put his m&ms In alphabetical order.

Well,he just sent a text. What's a text? You know,sometimes, To get perspective, I like to think about A spaceman on a star Incredibly far away. And our problems Don't matter to him Because we're just A distant point of light. But he feels sorry for me. Because he has an incredibly Powerful microscope And he can see my face. I'm okay. No,i'm not. Uh,phyllis,there's a package for you. Sign here. Okay. Got it. Sam. Sam,sam. It's not that you dumped My granddaughter, And it's not that You want children. It--it's that you lied to me.

And i guess he's never Felt that with my mom, Even at their best. You okay? Yeah. When you're a kid,you assume Your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna Be right about that. I guess it also means That sometimes love Affairs look different To the people inside them. I'm not insightful enough To be a movie critic. Maybe i could be a food critic. These muffins taste bad. Or an art critic. That painting is bad. Michael. It's really good to see you. Why are you wearing a turtleneck? Are you all right?
