Not enough blood getting to my hands. I think you look nice. Doesn't charles know he's compromising my attack readiness? It'sot a dress code. It's a death sentence. Looking good. 'Kay,thank you.

I wanted to start a company,not a war, Because in a war, You always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil war Is that brother fought ainst brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case,war was the right choice. This doesn't feel as important,though. That's just how the world works,i guess.
