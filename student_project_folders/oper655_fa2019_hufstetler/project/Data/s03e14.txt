DWIGHT: I have left Dunder Mifflin  after many record-breaking years,   and I'm officially on the job market  and it's very exciting.   For your convenience,  I've broken it down into three parts.   Professional resume,  athletic and special skills resume   and Dwight Schrute trivia.   DWIGHT: I am ready to face any challenges  that might be foolish enough to face me.   How would I describe myself? Three words.   Hardworking, alpha male, jackhammer.   Merciless, insatiable.   There's nothing on my horizon  except everything.   Everything is on my horizon.   I got this job to make some money  while I continue my employment search.   And it's fine for the time being.   (WATCH BEEPING)   Break's over.   Big Turkey?   (MUSIC PLAYING ON CELL PHONE)   He rocks in the treetop all a day long   Hoppin' and a-boppin'  and a-singin' the song   All the little birds on   Is that you singing?   All four parts. Recorded it on my computer.   JIM: Wow.  Took me forever.   Nice job.  Thank you muchly.   Oh rockin' robin  well you really gonna rock tonight   Every little swallow   You gonna answer it?   Every little bird in the tall oak tree   I called it myself.   Just thought you'd get a kick out  of the new ring.   Yikes.   Side note, just like to say I'm thrilled  to be working directly beneath you.   Cool.  I feel I have a lot to learn from you,   even though you're younger  and have less experience.   So here's to the future, Andy and the Tuna.   (SINGING) Andy and the Tuna   Oh, what a duo, magical  Andy and the Tuna   I miss Dwight.   Congratulations, universe, you win.   Yes, Dwight Schrute has left the company.  More personnel turnover.   Cost of doing business.   Right, addition by subtraction.   What does that even mean?  That is impossible.   Yeah, you're right.   But there is some good news.  Oscar is back, addition by addition.   So we are going to have a big party today  to welcome him back,   and hopefully, that'll lift everyone's spirits.   Hi, everyone.   Oh, hello, Oscar. How was your gaycation?   That's very funny.   Yeah? I thought of that like two seconds  after you left.   Hi, Angela.   Oscar.   Hey, boss.  MICHAEL: Hey, what's up?   Nothing.   Man. TGI Wednesday.   Am I right?  Yep.   Gonna go home, get my beer on,  get my Lost on.   What're you doing later?  You wanna hang out?   Oh, I don't know, maybe.  Well, I'll take that as a maybe.   Where're you going?  Bathroom.   Oh, I'm going to the kitchen,  I'll walk with you.   Things are going pretty good.  Getting a lot of face time with the boss.   Oscar, I have a question.   Would you like to join  the Party Planning Committee?   The committee with all the women?  Yeah.   Because I'm gay?  No, no.   Certain events have transpired  and I've thought about certain things,   and I'm sorry for the way  those certain events transpired.   And I would just like to make some changes  about certain things.   And certain situations and certain accounts.   Okay, okay. All right, all right, I'll join.  I'd love to.   That's Thank you.   Thank you.  Thank you.   Can I join, too?   Never.   You sell those two printers this morning?  Nice work.   Child's play.  Give me something hard to sell.   Wow, what is wrong with this thing?  It looks terrible.   Do you want me to ask  the night cleaning crew   if they stopped watering it?   Yeah. Oh, you know what?  Ask them about the toys on my desk, too.   They always used to arrange the toys  on my desk in a very pleasing way.   It used to brighten my morning.   Oh, that wasn't the night crew.  That was Dwight.   Really? That was very nice of him.   We need more attitude like that  around this office.   Feel you, dawg.  Yeah, do you?   Absolutely.  What did I say?   You said   (MUMBLING)   Which is like Right on.  Pam was like,  Blah, blah, blah,    and you're like,  Yeah.    (EXCLAIMS)   Nailed it.   Wow.   Love that Andy, right? Solid fellow.  Seems smart enough.   Likes me a lot.   A lot? Too much.   Like a crazy person a little.   Not super crazy, just   There's something about him  that creeps me out.   I can't really explain it.   He's always up in my biznezz,   which is Ebonics for being in my face  and annoying the bejesus out of me.   I don't understand how someone  can have so little self-awareness.   I really have no preference.  We don't even have to have a party.   No, hey. Hey, don't be ridiculous.  Of course we're going to have a party.   The celebration of Oscar. Oscar night.   And I wanted to be Oscar specific.   Michael  No. No, I mean, not because you're gay.   Your gayness does not define you.   Your Mexicanness is what defines you  to me.   And I think we should celebrate  Oscar's Mexicanity.   So, Phyllis,  I want you to go find firecrackers   and a Chihuahua.   Pam, in the frozen food section,   Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga.   Why don't you have me riding in  on a donkey into the office, Michael?   Would that be good?  A burro.   Of course, if Oscar wants a donkey,  let's get him one.   Need any help?   Oh, no, thank you. I'm just looking.   Great.   I will literally be standing right here  if you need anything at all.   Think I could go for some tuna fish  right about now.   Got my rod here.   (MIMICKING FISHING ROD)   Click, click, click, click.  Click, click, click, click.   Click, click, click, click.   (GRUNTING)   Hey.  Hey.   Hey, so Andy is in rare form today.   Yeah, you should not encourage him.   Encourage him? I'm the victim, okay?  He's fishing for me.   We gotta do something.   Look, I've got like 15 new clients  that I've inherited from Dwight   and each file is password protected  with a different mythical creature, so   I'm sorry. I can't.   Fine.   Party pooper.   (GRUNTING)   MICHAEL: Who's that sportscaster  that bit that lady?   Mar-something?   Andy is like Mar-something.  Great sportscaster, big weirdo creep.   185-pounder. Check it out.   Hey, guys.   How's the workload?   All of Dwight's old accounts.  Handling it okay?   Sort of. He had a lot of clients.   Yes, he did.   Have any of you talked to Dwight?   Oh, sure, we talk all the time.   Really?  No.   Don't do that. It's not nice.   What about you, Phyllis?  You and Dwight were close.   No, sorry.   Dwight had a big personality  and I have a big personality.   And a lot of times when two people like that  get together, it can be explosive.   Really coming down out there.  The commute's gonna be hell.   I have snow tires and chains,   plus exceptional hand-eye coordination.   So, where were you working before this?   Dunder Mifflin.  What kind of company is that?   Paper company.   We're only one of Staples'  top competitors in the area.   I never heard of them.   Oh, really? Have you heard of paper?   It's gonna be like that, huh?   I don't like him, his giant head,  or his beady, little eyes.   That's all I got to say on the matter.   (SINGING) In your head   in your head   Zombie, Zombie   Zombie   In your head   Would you like to pull a prank on Andy?   I'm kind of in the middle Yes, please.   Okay, good. Stay right here.   Zombie   In your head   Sorry about that.  Oh, smooth move, Tuna.   Nice one.   Are there any messages?  No.   So weird.   Nice to have Oscar back.   Yeah.   (MUSIC PLAYING ON CELL PHONE)   He rocks in the treetop all a day long   Hoppin' and a-boppin'  and a-singin' the song   Large Tuna,  have you seen my cell phone device?   No.  'Cause someone is calling right now.   There is a call.   well you really gonna rock tonight   Every little swallow   Angela.   Is everything okay?   No.   (MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING)   He rocks in the treetop   What's going on?   What're you talking about?   Where is my freaking phone?   Love to hear the robin goin'   You know what? Maybe it's in the ceiling.   You know what?  Maybe you're in the ceiling.   Okay.   ANDY: I don't trust you, Phyllis.   Every little swallow, every chickadee   I wanted to let you know that  Dwight was late that morning   because he had to drive to New York  to drop off the quarterly tax forms   that I forgot to send.   Why would Dwight do that for you?   I think I know why.   Because Dwight loves this company.   Do you think that anyone else out there  would've driven to corporate for you?   None of them. Especially not Andy.   Oh rockin' robin  well you really gonna rock tonight   Pam, I have a mission to accomplish.  Make sure this party gets rolling   and I will be back shortly.   Where are you going?  Want me to come with?   Listen, I forgot to tell you the plan  for this Saturday.   You, me, bar, beers, buzzed.   Wings, shots, drunk. Waitresses, hot.   Football, Cornell, Hofstra. Slaughter.   Then, quick nap at my place  and we hit the tizzown.   No. I don't wanna do any of that.   Duh.  Which is why I was joking about doing it.   No, just stop. Stop. Just stop doing it.  You're going to drive me crazy.   Fine, I'll just go sit at my desk and be quiet.   Sorry I annoyed you with my friendship.   (MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING)   Excuse me.   He rocks in the treetop all a day long   And I'm also sorry that a lot of people here  for some reason think it's funny   to steal someone's personal property  and hide it from them.   Here's a little news flash.   It's not funny!   In fact, it's pretty freaking un-funny!   Every little swallow, every chickadee   God!   (GRUNTS)   The wise old owl and the big black crow   Flapping them wings   That was an overreaction.   Gonna hit the break room.  Does anybody want anything?   Pam, you good?   Yeah.  Sure? Okay.   DWIGHT: Well, that question is meaningless.   Just go with the copy paper,  it's your funeral.   See how that works out for you.   Hey.   Hey.  What's up?   Same old.   It takes a big man to admit his mistake,  and I am that big man.   Angela from accounting  told me what you did.   Oh, my God, she told you?  Yes, she did.   And, Dwight,   if you were willing to do something like that  for some random co-worker,   then clearly, I misjudged you  from the beginning.   And I apologize.   Accepted.   How's this place treating you?   My boss isn't funny.   I don't get to wear my ties.  No.   Sure.  So   So maybe you should come back.   You should come back. Please.   I don't wanna do your laundry anymore.   We can talk about that.   All right.   (MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO)   Oh, my God. That's half-inch dry wall.   I think we broke his brain.   JIM:  It's not freaking funny!    You really enjoying your fiesta?  Actually, yeah.   I didn't think I would but turns out it's great.   Ladies and gentlemen,  may I present Mr. Dwight Schrute.   Welcome back.  Thank you.   Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand.  You're gonna break it.   Not bad, huh?   You did this for me?   Guilty.   Hey.   Do you still have feelings for her?   Yes.   And now, ladies and gentlemen,  the big finale.   Sir, would you do the honor?   Oh, man.   No, no, no, no. I don't need it.   (YELLING)   MICHAEL: It takes a big man to admit  his mistake and that's what I did.   The important thing is, I learned something.   I don't want somebody sucking up to me   because they think  I'm going to help their career.   I want them sucking up to me  because they genuinely love me.   So Michael had a little chat with corporate   and they decided to send me  to management training.   Anger management, technically,  but still, management material.   This whole thing's supposed to take  10 weeks.   I expect to be done in five.   How? Name repetition, personality mirroring  and positive reinforcement   through nods and smiles.   So don't worry about old Andy Bernard.  I'll be back.   Just like Rambo.   Oh, hi, you must be Andy.   Oh, hi. Yes, I am, and you must be Marcy.   That's right, it's so good to meet you.  It's so good to meet you.   Thanks. Well, you ready to have some fun?  Yeah.
