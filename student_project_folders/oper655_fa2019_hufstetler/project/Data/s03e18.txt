Did you get a chance to try Michael's homemade potato salad? Rachel thinks that I brought homemade potato salad. But I just picked it up at the supermarket. It's funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good. It's just potatoes and mayonnaise. There's something wrong with Jan. What's What's with Jan and Michael? I don't know Where to begin. My ball. The chimney's in decent shape. Not great. I found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation. So, all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party. What? I want us to make it. I want a fresh start. That's awesome. That's what I want. Okay, but in order for us to make it, there can't be any secrets between us. I didn't I didn't do anything. Ask anybody. I totally could have and I didn't at all. Just listen. Remember that casino night about a month before we were supposed to get married? I kissed Jim. What?

Yeah. You're right. This is so over! Are you kidding me, Pam? Come on! God! Stupid jet skis! Our first fight. If this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle I feel sick. You didn't have any of the potato salad, did you? You know, we were good when we were just running around, you know? In secret. It was wrong and it was exciting, and maybe it was a mistake to take it public. Well, if that's the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly. Michael Greatly. Please don't cry. I'm not going to cry. I feel like it, but I am not going to. Why don't you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million pieces? It was never a love contract, Michael. Yeah. And besides, I have already given a copy to David. It would be just as embarrassing to get it back from him as it was handing it to him I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling and the giggling. I didn't mean it, okay? I was Whatever. I was tired. I'm tired and I didn't eat enough. And that's all. That was it. That's it. You didn't mean it. That's all. No, I didn't. So That's all. I'm just saying I didn't mean it. Okay. Fine. I love you, Jan. Okay. Don't break up, you guys. You're great together.
