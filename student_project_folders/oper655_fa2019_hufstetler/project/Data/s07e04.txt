I don't wanna talk about it anymore. I pick up day laborers And tell them that they'll get paid at 6:00 P.M. At 5:45, a certain I.N.S. Agent By the name of Mose Schrute Throws them in the back of a van, Drops them off in the middle of Harrisburg, And tells them it's Canada. Hola, amigo. Hola. TÃº es UN bueno worker? Si.

Who is this guy by our cars? That is my new maintenance worker Nate, And you'll be happy to know that he's taking care of That hornet's nest that you've been griping about. Yeah. I got stung up my dress. Poor hornet. I left him all the tools he needs. This is do or die. If he chooses correctly, he conquer the hornets. And if he doesn't? He'll die. What? Uh, beg your pardon? When did the phrase  do or die  become so corrupted? Is that a blowtorch? No. No, no, no! No, no! Interesting choice. OhYes. Very, very smart. Walking away. No! No, no, no! The bat. Oh, they're stinging him! No, no, no! No, no! Good morning, Erin. Any moustaches I mean messages? Terrific. There are many reasons A man would wear a fake moustache to work. He is a fan Of the outrageous. He loves to Surprise! He loves Other things as well. It's a pimple, Phyllis. Avril Lavigne gets them all the time, And she rocks harder than anyone alive. Uh, that's no pimple, Michael. You mean cancer? What? No way. No. Definitely not not cancer. It's just good to catch a Michael train of thought early Before it derails and destroys the entire town. Wait, wait, wait, wait. It's just a cold sore. It is? Yep. Just a cold sore. Just a cold sore. Thank you. Phyllis, I don't have acne. I have a cold sore. I didn't even have a cold. I don't know how I got it. I know how you got it. How? Michael, come on. A cold sore is herpes. What? What you should do, Michael, Is have a doctor take a look at it, 'cause we don't really know what that is. I know tons and tons of people who have herpes. I have it myself. That's what it is. I've never seen herpes on you. 'cause it's on my genitals, genius. You have a penis? Michael, have you ever been tested for STDs? Yeah. My last physical when I was 40. That was like ten years ago. No, it was like four years ago. Michael, you're at least 46. Why at least? If you're guessing 46, just say 46. Can please talk about how gross Meredith is? This is what you get When you treat your body like an outhouse. You know what, guys? How 'bout we just chill out a little bit on the herp chat? Okay? I was an r.A. In college, And I can tell you, The number one sexually transmitted disease Is ignorance. I guess maybe she could marry a meth dealer with crabs I don't even want to know about these things. Hey, guys. How did this happen? How did I get this? Sometimes it can lie dormant in a woman for years. They may not even ow that they have it. You ow what? I feel like One of those old-timey sailors with VD. Eh, it's me own darn fault. Girl in every port! But what port? The Jan port? The Holly port? Don't even Holly was clean, okay? If anything, I gave it to her. You may have. Oh, my God. What if I did? You need to contact Holly. You need to notify her that she is crawling with herpes. Okay. You know what? Might. Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her. You need to contact every woman you've been with And notify them of your herpes infestation. It's the right thing to do. There's no way I'm gonna do that. Then I will. All right, I Now, I'm no doctor, but it seems to me That we all have an obligation to the public health To track down anyone who gives us a disease, Inform them of it, And take overwhelming revenge on that person. Again, I'm no doctor. I'm just a normal guy who enjoys revenge. Hello. Hi, Donna. It's Michael. Michael. I didn't think I'd hear from you. How've you been? I have a disease For which there is no known cure That has been sexually transmitted to me. Oh, no! I can't even say it. HI Oh, my God! RP E.E W-wait. S. You're calling to tell me that you have herpes? No. I am calling to see if you gave me herpes, Because if you did, I would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations. So you have it, right? No. Does your stupid husband have it? No, he doesn't. Are you telling me I have to get tested? Yes, I'm telling you you have to get tested for herpes. Good-bye! So long, Donna. 'scuse me, everyone, can I have your attention, please? Not again. What do you mean, again? You're always asking for our attention. Well, maybe like a year ago. Mm. Seems recent. No, that's Andy, the reason it seems more recent Is because many of us here have never stood up And asked for everyone's attention, And it seems like you've done that on several occasions. Everyone, I've noticed that We've not been entirely kind to one of our own, Due to stigmas and prejudices. Oh, when you got your new phone That's when you asked for everyone's attention. World cup. That's what I was thinkin'. You kept announcing scores. It's the world's only international sport, so This is hoy. No, this is Holly. No This is Holly. No, this is Holly. NoThis is Michael Scott.

What did you think we were? Just a Quirky indie movie Weird sorta thing Breakin' all the rules But had to end Because the summer was over. For you. I-I think that for you to have come here Even expecting That we could have a conversation like this Shows how how self-deluded you are. Michael, yourMemory has failed you greatly. Jerk. Michael So this is a chef's kitchen, Which makes it perfect for real entertainers. Real entertainer, like Billy Joel. Michael. Carole. How are you? I'm great. How are you? I'm great. I saw your sign outside, And I decided, I'm gonna pull in, And maybe I'm going to buy a house from her. Oh. You didn't call my office And ask them where I was? No! that's so 'cause the receptionist told me that a man called, But he would only say that he was my ex-lover. Weird. Yeah. Sounds like a nice guy. I don't know, I mean, people were being really mean to Meredith But this wasn't really about Meredith, was it? You and Erin were broken up How is that relevant to anything? I asked you if it was okay if I asked her out. You said and I quote  my good sir, nothing would make me happier Than to hand you the hand of the hand once in my hand.  I specifically remembered it Because you said it in such a weird way. Well, the only reason I said that Is 'cause you asked me so politely And it was very difficult for me to say no. I'll let this slide. But I expect you to put this whole Erin thing behind you. Oh, wow. Another living room. It's a family room. You put the tv there. You put your family here. Michael, why are you here? Somebody told me That I romanticize relationships. You know, we all do that. I have herpes. What? Did you have that while we were together? I just found out today.

Actually, you do make a bigger deal out of things Than you need to. You proposed to me on our fourth date. Well, I believe in love at first sight. Well, so do I, But we didn't love each other at first either. I don't know what you were thinking. I know what I was thinking at the time, But right now, it just seems ridiculous. Excuse me. Someone died in the upstairs bathroom, didn't they? No. We should Schedule meetings, 'cause the days can slip away with chitchat. Are you crying? No. I'm just sweating.
