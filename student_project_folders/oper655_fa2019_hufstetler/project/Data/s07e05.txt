And, to be honest, so did I. And the only reason I got out of the sales game Was to be reluctantly called back in. You don't look reluctant, Michael. You look really eager. [laughing.] no, I don't have time for this. Are you kidding me? You don't? No! Okay. All right!  knockity-knock, don't knock back  Just kidding, you can knock. It's your office. Do you have a minute?

We just got bested. Why is there a door close button If it doesn't even close the door? How do I feel about losing the sale? It's like if Michael Phelps came out of retirement, Jumped in the pool, belly-flopped, and drowned. You know who we always lose out to? Staples, the big guys. Osprey? They're a small company. They're smaller than we are. What's our excuse? How do we combat this guy? Stanley, how do we combat him? We sell better? Okay. You know what? You clearly don't care, so why don't you just leave? I would like to stay. This pertains to me. Why don't you go outside andTake a shot of insulin And have a nap, okay? Why do you always assume I have diabetes? I don't know. Your frame, your build. Why don't you have a glass of apple juice And tell me you're not a diabetic. [grunts.] See? I could tell by the sound you made when you stood up That you have--okay. Yes, Phyllis? I could try to seduce him. Oh, my god! I know how we can learn his tricks. What I'm about to show you is of the utmost secrecy. Is that your office? Yes, Jim. And with a little tweaky, it becomes a different office. We lure Danny to it and watch him sell. Ehh I'm outta here. This is weird. You know what this is? This is a stinger. A what? Like the movie. Oh, you mean the sting. Paul Newman, Robert Redford. They're bank robbers? Nope. Different movie. The sting. The sting. Your 2:00. Thanks, hon.

SoThe song is from the point of view of a little girl. Yeah. But you're singing it. Yeah. But I'm using my falsetto. No, that's not a good idea. It's not a very good song. Yeah, well, it'd sound a lot better If you actually sang with some soul. Oh, I never sing with soul. That's a lie. I could sing it. I just was hoping maybe You'd save youvoice In case we did a novelty song about frogs. But my voice is unique. Like Bob Dylan. Okay, three-way argument Between a drummer, a keyboardist, And the front man le singer. Wonder who's gonna win this one. Two, three, four-- I'm gonna take off my coat, if you don't mind. It's a bit warm in here. Hello! Oh, no, no, no. Don't People can't keep their true natures hidden for long, And this guy is smoldering like a tire fire. Testify. He's not that good-looking.

But do y think it could be famous? Like in a car commercial or something? Not really. It's kinda weird that a grown man Is singing from the point of view of a little girl.
