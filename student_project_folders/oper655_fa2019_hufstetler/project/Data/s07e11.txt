Got it. Okay, let's go. I'm freezing. People, wait, wait, wait. Come back, come back. One fun one. We're gonna do a fun one. One Charlie's angels. One. Let's go. Okay, this is just a Christmas card from your paper supplier. No one's putting this on their fridge. Ooh, I got it, you guys, how 'bout this Michael, what if all the boys are on one side, all the girls are on the other. The boys are, like,  why, I oughta,  and the girls are, like,  let's go shopping ? Let's just jump in the air. That's it! That's a picture! Yes! Jump in the air. We're gonna jump in the air. Here we go. Okay, one TwoThree Not everyone jumped. Okay, everybody jump in the air this time, please. Here we go. One, two, three. Still some people not jumping. You gotta be kidding me. Who isn't jumping? I'll tell you who. Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, Angela, and Oscar. I am jumping. You are? Let me see you jump. Oh, my God. This is a store-bought camera. This isn't one of those special military-grade cameras that would be able to capture that. I'm freezing. Um, also, Erin is jumping way too early. She's on the ground by  three.  I didn't want to miss it. Well, if we all jump really high, we'll be in the air longer. Do that. Here's a question nobody's asking Is this worth it? Don't answer that. People, listen up and listen good. We need to just get one picture where we're all in the air at the same time. Yes? Why? I believe in us. We can do this. Okay, on three, everyone in the air. Three, two, one, zero. We didn't get it. I'm the office administrator now, which means I'm basically being paid to be head of the party planning committee. The first thing I did as head I shut it down. At its worst it was a toxic political club used to make others feel miserable and left out. At its best it planned parties. It hardly looks fake. It's so lush. Why does it smell real? AhGood one. Oh, ho, ho, ho! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas, little children! Merry Christmas. How's everybody doing today? Good. Good. How's the party coming along? Great. Are we over budget? Nope. No? Good. Did anyone get drunk already? Not yet. Good for you. Angela, lay it on me What's the problem? Nothing. Should be fun. So, Stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today? Pam got those sugar-free cookies I like. I'm doing fine. All right, well, I will be in my office making toys for the good children. Andy? Yeah? What you got? It's all good, Santa. Well, that's a relief. Santa's gonna take some much-needed free time. All right. Good! My kids are growing up. As a boss, I look at that and I say great. It is exactly what a boss would hope would happen because that's what I want. That's what every boss wants, is a is a wonderful Christmas with no drama. It's present time, you guys. Happy holidays from your friends at Sabre. We just want to say how grateful we are. Sabre is actively looking for ways to involve me as minority executive trainee. So I suggested choosing the annual Christmas gift to the employees. And they said,  oh, yes. Perfect. Thank you, Kelly. Finally, something for you to do.  It's a hello kitty laptop sleeve. Hello kitty's for girls. Nashua got mp3 players. Yeah, I don't even have a laptop. I wonder if these presents would be under as much scrutiny if I were white. Wow Come on. I said  I wonder.  I didn't say  I think.  Kelly, I thought we agreed on fleece blankets. Blankets? What am I, five? Erin and I make great use of ours. Yes, Erin and I are still dating. Why do you ask me so often if we're still dating? I'll take one of those pink pouches. I feel good today. My little girl Jada? It's my turn to have her for Christmas this year. Two years ago I had her, and we had the best time. I TiVoed her favorite shows, some things I've never heard of. iCarly You know who's funny on that show? The friend with the video camera. He's got a nice way of talking. Hey, it's snowing. Oh, my God! It's the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? It's not even a real snow. Look, it's a dusting. Pitiful. Hey, Dwight. Whoo! Damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here! Well, it's not a snowball, 'cause it's only a dusting. Right? Look at that. There's a pebble in there. You could have killed me! Oh, don't be such a baby. Yeah, who's a little girl now? You apologize to me right now. You've got something on your nose. You apologize right now. No. Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter. You got it. That sounds awesome. Can we all do it? No, Andy, it's a snowball fight. It's not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it. Jim, let go. Let go. Angela, are you bringing your new boyfriend to the party? I wouldn't subject Robert to that. He's a very busy senator. State senator. I would not expect you to know what it's like to date someone in the public arena. Who are you dating in the public arena? The senator. Oh, right. The state senator. We went to a picnic thrown my the comptroller's wife. Oh, that would be impressive If anyone knew what a comptroller was. Well Do you have any idea how many photographers there are at a ribbon-cutting ceremony? I do. Two.  Angela   Over here, Angela   Here. Look here!  Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that Yeah! A party. It's not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind. Pam? Pam? Pam? Wow, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement. Hi, guys. Hi. I just wanted to let you know that I'll be taking a leave of absence starting next week. Because you've been on the lam? Because the  boring police  have been after you, and they finally caught up with you? No, the opposite. I was actually selected to be a juror on a very high-profile case. Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby! Death to Toby! Okay, that's hurtful talk. We've talked about that. You know, I don't interrupt your announcements. You leave these huge pauses in your sentences. What do you expect me to do? What's the case, Toby? Well, I really can't talk about it, but it's a very high-profile case. Is it criminal? Yes. Have we heard of it? I don't know. Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a sex slave? Come on. Was it the post office guy who rubbed his penis all over the mail? Guys, it's a really big deal. He's rubbing his neck. He's rubbing his neck! He's rubbing his neck. Oh, Scranton strangler! I can neither confirm nor deny this. Let's just say I'll be up to my neck in jury duty. That was the worst joke ever. Corporate will be sending someone else to take my place. Okay, good-bye. Good-bye. Uh, Holly flax She comes from the Nashua branch. What? What? Yeah, she'll be starting next week. If you have any questions about the transition, just let me know. Hold on, Holly's coming back here? Yeah. Guys, who's Holly? That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover And was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future? Wow. She's one sassy black lady. Holly's coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party. I'm not sure the temporary replacement of an hr rep really warrants a party. You know what, we'll postpone this party until then. This is too important. Cancel this one. Dwight, get rid of the tree. Okay. Cancel. We're canceling it. No, don't throw them out! No, we have to cancel We can save that. No, no, no. We're gonna get fresh for Holly. I bought these. These cookies are fine! They're not. Fresh and new. Michael, wait. We don't have We don't have the budget for another party. Well, then, everybody will chip in It'll be fine. I honestly think you're idealizing people here again, Michael. I don't think that's gonna happen. You know what, I'll pay for it. I'll pay for the party. This is way too important. People, Holly's coming back, and this is the most important Christmas party of my life. So back to work. Oh, boy. Man, I worked hard. I worked so hard for this! I was after corporate constantly. I emailed Joe. I wrote letters. And you know who I end up owing this to is the Scranton strangler. Thank you. Thank you, Scranton strangler. I love you! You just took one more person's breath away. We have always had good Christmas parties here, as you know, but they've never been cool. The name is bondSanta bond. I'll have an eggnog, shaken, not stirred. Classic Brosnan. SantaWonderful tradition. Everybody loves Santa. Everybody can't get enough of the jolly old man. But that is a myth, because you know what, he is not necessarily a big fat guy with a beard. He's not necessarily an old guy. No one knows what the real Santa Claus God! Ow! Just stop moving your calves so much while you're talking. Well, this year's gonna be different. We're gonna have fun. It's not gonna be tacky. It's going to be You know what, the food is going to be austere. It is not going to be tacky, deli platter food. It's not gonna have a big, fat, gross Santa Claus. It's gonna be a cool, sleek Santa. Maybe I'll bring my boyfriend. I'll invite him. Okay. Sure. I mean, unless there's any chance there could be *pss at this party. You never know about the press. Well, I only ask because he's a senator. Could he help us with some parking tickets? I don't think that's appropriate. Well, then he's not a senator. Yes, he is. Okay. Hey. Hey. We still doing the gifts today? I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party. Yes. But don't get too excited, 'cause I didn't have a lot of time this year. Me neither. Whew. Okay. I've been working forever on Jim's present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. He'll take a memory or a private joke, and he'll create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear becomes a  bear man.  Wreaks havoc on the office. It's really good. Okay Oh, no, no, no, no! Fake tree. No! No, it has the little Pam, no, no. Holly's coming from new Hampshire. Somebody from new Hampshire looks at that and thinks it's a burning cross. No, no. I want you to go and get a real tree. Take some money. Thank you. Hi, I'm looking for Michael Scott. Yes, that's me. Come on in. There's nothing classier than boring jazz music, I am here to tell ya. And I made a bit of a judgment call. I hired one musician, because I thought, what's better, to hire an entire quartet for half an hour, or one bassist for the entire day?   Hey, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree? I would, but I don't want to get dirty. There might be girls at the party. Why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party? No one invited girls. It's just us. I will help. Although my 'bridMy hybrid My Prius hybrid, won't fit a tree. Which is ironic, considering how many trees it saves on a daily basis. Yeah. I do, however, have a hookup with a dude who has a pickup. Oh, do you mean Darryl? That's a great idea. I'll ask him. You know Darryl? Yeah. He works here. We all know him. I should come along, just 'cause he's my You know, he's my hookup. Cool. Come on, now, Justine, look Listen Look, I've been planning this, okay? You cannot do this, Justine. I'm not doing it! She told me she wants to have Christmas here. She did? Yes. She wants to be around family for Christmas. I don't know I thought I was enough family for my daughter. Don't come in, I'm busy. It's cool, Darryl, I'm here too. Hey, sorry, I really didn't want to come in. It's just that we have to go buy a new Christmas tree, and we're hoping we could borrow your truck. Uh, no. Come on, it'll be fun. We could do doughnuts in the snow on the way back. No. Thank you for your interest in my truck. Okay. Sorry. We'll leave you ale. Hey [Sighs you know what, I could use a breath of fresh air. Let's do it. When Holly gets here, I want you to be very helpful to her. I've looked her up online There's nothing about her. She's made no impression on the Internet. She doesn't need an Internet presence You just know. Oh Hey. Hi. What the hell are you doing here? You're supposed to be in the courthouse. We're on recess. I came for the party. Hi. Hey, everyone. Hi, Toby. What does the strangler look like? Is he gorgeous? He looks gorgeous in the drawings. Yeah. That scowl. I can't talk about it or I'll get removed from the jury. And then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions. I know people are only this excited to talk to me because of the trial. But they talk to me for a while, and maybe people realize I have something to say. And then one day, we're just talking. You've reached the voice mail of Dwight Kurt Schrute. Please leave Raaaaugh! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Stop! OhOh! I have no feeling in my fingers or penis. But I think it was worth it. Aah! Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and he just kept throwing 'em until he exhausted himself. And, uhThen  How 'bout icing it? Lol. Dwight.  Hi. Hello. Is there any way I can get a hand with these, please? I'm really sorry, I can't help you. I'm waiting for my boss' pretty friend to arrive. There she is. Hey. Erin, would you help her, for God's sake? Oh, you're Holly! Of course. Sorry. Hello. Well, well, well, if it isn't Michael Scott. You old bastard. Well, I never thought I'd see your face around these parts, you old bastard! Well, I did show my face around these parts, you old bastard. Why, you're some sorta wise guy, huh? I most certainly am. Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk! Unnnnnngh! D'oh! Oh, Homey. OkayHolly's back. Hi. Hi. Oh, huggy monster! Oh, not the huggy monster! I don't want to die! I don't want to die! I don't want to die! Wow. Well, everybody, you remember Holly. Hi. Did you bring us anything from Nashua? Oh, yeah. I brought some maple candy. But I have to admit, I got a little hungry on the drive, and I ate some of them. That's adorable. Would you put those out? To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone? Oh, it's so nice to be back. It looks beautiful in here. Super-classy. It's like a party for limousine drivers. Well, you came on the day of our Christmas party. Oh, it's fabulous. I love what you did! Isn't it wonderful? We love it here. Don't you love it? All right, let me show you to your desk. I show you to your dayyy-esk! Watch out for my guns. They're both loaded. What kind of guns do you have? Six-shooter? Aww This is weird. I can't believe you're here. This feels like you never left. Doesn't it? Yeah, kind of. Yeah. Oh, God. Oh, and you have a Woody. Bah! OhI love Aj gave me that. Well, that's understandable. Still raw. Woody your favorite character? Mm-hmm. You know who my favorite character in toy story is? Andy's mom. Why? Because without Andy's mom, there's no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie. That is a really good point. Aj said he hadn't seen any of the toy story movies. You're kidding me. No. I know. I'm going,  what? Are you serious?  What a douche bag! Get a life! Get a Yeah. Good riddance. We sat down and we watched them all in one day. Now he's the biggest toy story fanatic ever. Good for him. Next day I found him in my bed. Really? That's creepy. How did Aj get in your house? We live together. Oh, you do? He had a little note pinned to him that said,  you've got a friend in me.  Yeah, Randy Newman's the best. Yeah. I love him. Me too.  Christmas tree, Christmas tree   won't you be my Christmas tree?  Hey, how about this one? Ehh, seems a little full of itself, right? Kind of a pretty boy. What if we got a really beat up one, like on Charlie brown. And we just loved it for what it is? Maybe. I mean No, she be talking to your mom or something. This is my daughter too, Justine! You seem to think Oh Pick a damn tree already. Um, hey, Darryl, listen, it's none of my business, but if I couldn't have Cece for Christmas, I'd be really upset too. I don't have kids or anything, but if my grandmother ever dies, I'm going to kill myself. Jada don't want to spend Christmas with me. She told her mom it wasn't as much fun. How could she say that? You know, I took her to the toy store to buy her own presents. Well, Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents. Her mom wants me to take her to mass. I guess that's something to do. No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas. How do I do that? Bring her to the party. Yeah, we'll have Santa, and we'll play games with her. It'll be a lot of fun. Yes! You'll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night. Hey, guys, the tree's here. Hey. Nobody hug me I'm covered in tree sap, so Why would someone hug you? Hey there, Jada. Nice to see you again. I'm Santa Claus. Welcome. Are you serious? It's a sophisticated take. He doesn't look like Santa Claus. No, he doesn't. I told her Santa would be here. Yeah, well, I was told that Holly would be here, single and ready to date. And we all got misled. Who told you that? Nora Ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made. So is it an open relationship? Oh, God, no. Well, you're almost 40. Oh, do you not want kids? Oh, I want kids. I really want kids. But Aj and I are practically engaged. We talk about spending our lives together. So where's the ring? Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move? Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb. You guys, I don't think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life. Yeah, I mean, maybe Holly's not in any position to be shooing guys away. I don't get it. I'm sorry. I just I don't get it. Okay, listen, I'm gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose by the end of this year, we're over. Wow, an ultimatum. Yeah. It doesn't really seem like you. That is a great idea. Ultimatums are key. Basically, nobody does anything for me anymore unless I threaten to kill myself. Don't. Stop Dwight! Dwight, stop! Oh, no. Oh, no! Stop! Oh, no. Yes, taste my wrath! Okay. Okay You like that? Seriously! Okay. Okay. Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office. You never know when you're gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone. I just want it to stop. So cool, right? There's no connection between the origin story and the quest. Okay. We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear. Otherwise it's the bear's quest. Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right? Well, did you come here for help, or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is? I mean, help, if it's something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or It sounds like you know what you want. It's also a little derivative of a serial called bear man. Did you look that up? No. Okay. Oh, Jim. Hey. Hey, Toby. There's this female stenographer at the courthouse No way. Who looks exactly like you. That's incredible. Yeah. No, it's uncanny. You know what's crazy? I can't reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second. Oh! Excuse me. I guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you don't. And that's just the way it is. And I can be mature about that. It's so cold. Even with my coat on. Maybe your senator boyfriend has a blanket in his car for screwing Americans. Yet another opportunity where a blanket would have come in handy. You guys, this has to stop. Someone could have really gotten hurt. What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny, but it also would have been incredibly tragic. I could not agree more. And I just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress. What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me. With snowballs, Jim? With Fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing. Dwight's right. What you did was dangerous and inappropriate. Mmm, mmm. Mm-hmm. I'm really surprised at you guys. Last time I was here, you were both best friends. All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk? Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York city. Wait, what girlfriend? I haven't told you about her. I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit. I'm a man in my mid-40s and I still get zits. I think that's pretty interesting. But you know what, I am not on trial here. The Scranton strangler is. So anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to JFK, but I'm flying out of Laguardia. So we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around slomo drinking latte. And at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says,  Michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab.  I didn't know you had a girlfriend. I do. She is. Did you see her face? Well, it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for Michael g. Scott. And it ain't Tara. So you went homemade this year. Yep. Yeah. Money problems Is that what this is about? I mean, oh, dear, I don't think we can help you out. No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion. Are you good at homemade? Look at this. Yeah. Who did this? It's obvious to me I'm not welcome here, but somebody better tell me who did this, or else I'm leaving. Well, I don't think Erin seems to like you. That's not true. I don't know her enough to make a decision even. What happened? What happened? Toby, what did you do? I think Toby's very jealous of all the attention you've been getting. No, I would never ever do anything like that. But it does seem like something you would do. Oh, really? Turn it on me. Well, isn't that nice? Thank you very much. Wait, wait, guys, listen. Toy story is all about toys that come to life when people aren't looking. You don't think It's not possible That Woody did this to himself? It is Christmas. No, it really seems like something Michael would do. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well, the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me. And that I have been framed. Why would anyone frame you for that? Okay, I'm sorry, why are we discounting this whole  Woody came to life  thing so quickly? AaaaahhAhh, Ahh! Surprise! It was part of the party. Pretty funny, huh? You think this is funny? I don't. But someday I think we will laugh about this When we tell our kids Yikes. Oh, my God. All right! Shh. Okay You know what, Holly, I didn't mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings. Michael, you have to let this go. I'm with someone else. I don't feel that way anymore. Oh, really? Well, you certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. That's what Jim and Dwight thought. Okay, hey, hey, hey No, fake girlfriends are always wrong. You made up a fake girlfriend to see if I'd get jealous? And you destroyed a gift my boyfriend gave me? What is the matter with you? When you got transferred, and I drove you up to Nashua, you said,  Michael, I love you, but I can't do this.  But then, with this other guy, you don't have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you? And you know what, that is what is the matter with me. Michael, I'm sorry. And we did this whole stupid party for you. No. You guys, it wasn't my fault. Nothing is ever your fault. Just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us! I really think you're better off. Mmm. Erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please? Yeah. Is she an amazing cook or something?  Hey, pickles, Merry Christmas.  Open immediately? Love, Swiss cheese. Damn it, Dwight! Didn't think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim? Let that be a lesson to you all. So do they bring in food, or do you get to go out? No, they bring it in. You lucky son of a bitch. I have been trying to get on jury duty every single year since I was 18 years old. To get to go sit in an air-conditioned room downtown, judging people while my lunch is paid for That is the life. Daddy, I'm bored. Can I read my book in your office? Sure, sweetie. Jada, Darryl, I'm so glad I found you guys. A Grinch stole the star from on top of the Christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere. You want to go help me find him? Oh, my goodness.   I am the mean old Grinch. The little girl who wishes to win back the Christmas star must first succeed at these challenges. Ohh, that sounds fun and christmasy, you mean old Grinch. What kind of challenges? Waahhh Something like an obstacle course, Mr. Grinch? No. You must answer topical political question something like an ob how many congressmeninch?  Is the state of Pennsylvania guaranteed? And what other state has the equal number?  I don't know. Do you know the other state? Maybe the Grinch hid the Christmas star, and we could ask for clues, and he'll tell us if we're hot or cold. The star has been hidden. Is the little girl hot or cold? Well, it turns out she's burning up because the star is right behind her ear! And the game's over seconds later. I'm so glad you could come. It's nice. I know. Hey, everybody, this is my boyfriend, senator Robert Lipton. Hi. Senator, it's an honor. I'm Angela's friend Oscar. Oscar. A pleasure. Robert seems great. He's very handsome, firm handshake, he's gay, good sense of humor. Hi. Hello. I'm, uh I'm Aj. I'm here to see Holly. It's kind of a surprise. I know who you are, and I think you should go. I bet you didn't even bring us anything, did you? Was I supposed to bring you guys something? What? Aj! Surprise. What are you doing here? Oh, my God. I wanted to see you. How are you? Wow! Nice. Oh, God, you look great. Oh When did you get here? Just now. Just now. Hey. Hey, Michael. Good to see you again, Aj. Welcome. Pleased to see you. Thank you. Good trip down? Yeah, it was great. Good, good. Good to see you. Have fun. Enjoy the partay. I am dead inside. What do you want, baby? We got some granola, got some cupcakes, chips, apples, pies You have a whole room of vending machines. I know. Isn't it something? I can't decide what I want.   Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Thank you. And Merry Christmas. Thank you. And Merry ChristMas. Thank you so much. Merry Christmas. And Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you. Merry Christmas. Oh, thank you. For your feet. It's amazing. 'S so great. Thank you. For me? Yes. Thank you very much. Mm-hmm. I don't know if you guys have had a chance to use the new parking meters that accept credit cards, but Robert was instrumental in that legislation. Wow, that's awesome! A real David and Goliath story. I'm just so touched that she's so interested in my work. I am. The real problem is the teachers' union. Zip it, Meredith. No. You tell me why my kid is 17 and still can't read. Hey, who's in charge of making drinks around here? Is there a bartender? You are. You make your own drink. I'll make it. What are you drinking? An  f  train to Brooklyn. Extra bitters. I don't know how to make that. Okay, well, I'll just stick with my Mohito. And you know those annoying geese at the park? Well, he's helping eradicate them as well. I mean, I think they've really become a pest. Annoying. Yes. I don't think he's in the ceiling, babe. Well, uhI don't think any of us really know. All right. Is it Is it pebbles from the beach in Jamaica? Ooh, go easy with the shaking. Oh, my God. You like it? I love it. Yep, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn't make that. All right, my turn. Oh, um, it's just I didn't I didn't have a lot of time, so that's just a place holder. Right. Of course.  The adventures of Jimmy Halpert.  OhMyGod. This is awesome! That's my bike. That's my desk. And that is my daughter. I mean Better office policy up there. It's not as fun as Scranton. But it should be the same policy as us. Michael, wait. Oh, hey, hey, no, don't run. You're gonna slip. That's good advice. Yep. I read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever. And then every day, her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died. That's a sad story. Yeah, well, at least he was married. Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everything's gonna be okay. No, it's not. It's not. Oh, man, I can tell you confidently that it is not gonna be okay. I shouldn't tell you this, but Aj won't commit to Holly.
