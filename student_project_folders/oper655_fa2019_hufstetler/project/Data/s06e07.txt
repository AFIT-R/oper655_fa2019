Oh,I know the best teacher. Her name's Miss janet. Yeah,on clearview avenue. Yeah!Yeah. This sounds ridiculous,I know, but some people say that I eat like a squirrel. So now you're comparing yourself to a cute,tiny animal? Um,michael? Hmm? The custodian called again. Apparently,a kol has died. It's a fish. They want you to pay for it. It could have died of natural causes,though. Well,they said you stepped on its head. He did not suffer. Um,when is the funeral? Do not mock,oscar. Do not mock. How much do they want? $300. What? No. I could get a fish for a five-cent worm. Oh,you're paying way too much for worms,then. Who's your worm guy? Okay,great meeting,everybody. That's it. No,no. Thank you. No! We are not done here.

I should wear a snorkel to the next business meeting that I go to. Michael,you know,when you think about it, it's not all your fault. I mean,who puts a kol pond in a lobby? Well,you know what? You're right,phyllis, but I've been there before. I've seen that pond. This is the thing,I am a world-class moron. Michael,please,stop it now.You're embarrassing yourself. It's okay. We're having fun. It's actually not the first time I've been embarrassed by a pond. Well In high school,the girl's volleyball team always used to throw me into the frozen lake. Four years in a row. Ha! Ohh! It was freezing! No,no,no! Oh,this is even worse. Couple of weeks ago,I went to get a new cell phone, and I wanted one of those packages where you have the five You know,the friends, friends and family thing?

Thanks for the advice. Enjoying your nut? Why? I'm not mocking.I was just making an observation about her Nut. I was. Hey,who wants to watch michael's pond dive? My roommate's friend is the night janitor over there. He swiped the security tape for me, and he's bringing it over. Mmm,you know what?Maybe we should go easy on michael,guys. You know,you watch that tape, and you're gonna have to stay late for more sensitivity training,so We'll stay late. Well,that went pretty well. Yeah,I guess. We got a maybe. Was our first maybe. Going by the nard-dog curve,i'd say we nailed it. If I'm being completely honest,I could have done without the belly kiss. You know what? I'm sorry, 'cause in that moment, I knew I was kissing your belly too much. Yeah,way too much. Yeah. I mean,what the hell was that? What the heck was that? When you cried. Ahh! Try  almost cried,  okay? I just got caught up in the fantasy. Your fantasy involves comparison shopping birthing classes? No. I know I'm gonna go with Miss janet. I just I don't know,it was fun to role-play,right? I mean,it's fun for me, having a wife and a little baby. I'm so sick of being single. Well,are you dating anyone? What do you think of erin? I mean,she's She's kinda cool. You think I can do better? I gotta get my goin' out on. Hey,let's watch this thing! Whoa! Oh,whoa,okay. Yeah,we're not watching this. How can we not watch this? What happened to  do not mock ? We're not mocking. We're watching. That will inevitably lead to mocking. Well,we'll deal with it as it comes. Is this the tape of me falling? Yes,put the dvd in. Open up quicktime. It starts on the song. No,use quicktime. Trust me,I've done this. Guys,michael can't handle this, and as your boss,I'm saying we're not watching it. No,it's okay. Watch it. He can't fire all of you. What are you doing? It's all right. I can handle it. No. I am a grown-up,jim. Shh! It's on. There they come. Boom! Did Did you see that? See what? Wait,why'd you stop it? Oscar,yes,you're right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it. Jim,you let michael fall in. Play it again. He purposefully leaned away and let you fall. Oh,man. I think when I started to see you go in,I think I just froze. I don't think you froze. It's a killer new dance move. Do you want to talk in your office? no. I didn't ask you. Would you like to talk? Judas. Jim is my enemy, but it turns out that jim is also his own worst enemy. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend, so jim is actually my friend. But because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy, so actually,jim is my enemy. But I should have grabbed you. I'm sorry. Look,I thought I could have done today's sales call alone. I mean,I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job. Jim is jealous of me? Jim is jealous of me. Hey,what's up,lifeguard? Oh,jim,I think I'm in your way. Oscar's a douche. No,he's all right. No,he's a Yeah,he's all right. Okay. Thanks,michael. You're welcome. Whoa! Almost fell. Hey,erin,do you mind faxing this for me? Oh,sure. Wait. Hand them to me upside down, so I don't accidentally read them. Okay. Thanks. Mm-hmm. How did today go by the way?Did you make any sales? No,it was a total waste of time. Um,it was fun,though, because I got to spend the day with andy bernard. He's really cool. Yeah,he is. Yeah,he is. He's like the coolest person I've ever met. That's Right. He's like marlon brando. Oh. Do you mean marlon wayans? 'cause he is. I actually do mean marlon wayans,yeah.
