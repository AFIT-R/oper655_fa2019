Michael? Yeah. Contractions are coming every 10 minutes. Just remember to keep breathing. My cervix is ripening. OK, good. Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight. Now, this baby will be related to Michael through delusion. Michael! My water's breaking! OK! OK! What do you do? I get a call from Jan and meet her at the hospital. Right. Highways or surface roads? I take Quincy Ave to Gibson. Gibson is covered in potholes. Car breaks down. Adapt! I checked the route, no potholes It's about adapting to the circumstances. Andy, would you like to have my baby? Yes! No. OK, I'm crowning! I'm crowning! All right. Sorry. Here we go. Here we go! The pressure! The pressure! Do it! Scream! Scream it out, scream it out! Babies are one of my many areas of expertise. Growing up, I performed my own circumcision. Just keep pushing I'm right here. Hold me! Cradle my head! I'm right here! I'm screaming, I'm screaming! All right. Just push and breathe. Numb me up. I want anesthesia! You can't have it. It's too late. I don't want natural! You have to just push it out! OK! Keep simulating. Do you have the Sharpie? Do you have the Sharpie? Yes, I do! When the baby emerges, mark it secretly in a kind of a mark that only you could recognize and no baby snatcher can ever copy. OK. Ready? Yes. It's coming! Here we go! God! What was on that? Butter. Newborns are slippery. Nice touch. Good. Let's try that again. It is going to be the happiest day of my life. Episode 5x03  Baby Shower  (1.00) Hello ladies, how's my shower going? Phyllis, did you get the live storks? No. Damn it, Phyllis! I'm sorry. Damn it, Phyllis It was hard enough to convince Jan to come. So are we set for refreshments? Per your instructions, we have the personalized M&M's with the baby names. This is your boy bowl, with the name  Chevy.  That was me. And this is the girl bowl, with M&M's with the name  Astird.  That can't be right. Michael wrote down  Astird.  She said it is the name of a Viking princess. So Ass turd. I know. I know. It is beautiful. No. Thank you. Is this it? I mean, is this Two bowls of M&M's and some balloons? You know what, I think you need to step it up. I think you need to get the lead out. Because if I'm not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here. We all came into this room and gave you, a golden shower. Well you know what, where's my golden shower? It does not matter to me at all, whether this baby is biologically mine. I am going to love it. It's like when the dog nurses the tiger cub. Have you seen that video? It is It's so bizarre and unnatural, but it happens. I'm collecting for the baby shower. But Phyllis, it's not his baby. I know, Kevin. Why do we have to pay money to get a gift for his ex-girlfriend's unborn sperm bank baby? Look at it as if you're paying for the cake, not the baby. Sheet cake. I do enjoy being the head of the Party Planning Committee. I'm no longer under Angela's heel, and her little grape head is under mine. What are you doing? Don't talk to them. Sorry. Make the party. Don't Make the party, please. Pump it! So you know Stacy, right? The one from England. There's no one from England. Katie studied in Ireland. This is Stacy, the one who does the Maira Kalman-style collages. Right, that style. So, Stacy and Eric get to Bogre's DeTech half an hour early so they don't have to sit on the slab. Anyway, Bogre's TA Sarah Kaya comes in. Wait, who's Sarah Kayacombsen? No, Sarah Kaya comes in. Don't interrupt, I have like 30 sec to finish this and get to DigiPres. So Sarah Kaya says to Eric,  No way. You can't reserve seats.  And Stacy gets all up in her face and Sarah picks up Stacy's new PM pad and throws it at the light box. No way! Yes! That's hilarious? No, it was horrible! Jim, she might get arrested. Who, Stacy? No, Stacy is a boy! Frustrating. Why can't you just be in art class with me? Wait, I gotta go, class starting. OK, I'll ta I'll talk to you later. That was a good story. Who's Sarah Kayacombsen? I got the Nard-puppy for ya. What's going on here? It's a baby game where you guess whose picture is whose. Check it out. Who would have thought that this little baby would be marrying that little baby? That's Phyllis. Well It is. So I hope you two are very happy together. Pervert. Why would that make me a pervert, Well, it does. That's me. That's not you. Yes it is. That's mean, come on, that's Ahoy, matey. Ahoy! So, how you doing? Good. Listen. Jan Levinson is coming in today, and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy. The child of which I have a vested interest. It's all kind of weird. Anyway, she is incredibly fat and enormous right now extremely unattractive. And you are, on the other hand, one of the more attractive people in the office. So while she's here I am going to be acting kind of cold to you. And I am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings. And I'm treating Ryan the same way. Of course. I do not like pregnant women in my workspace. They're always complaining. I have varicose veins, too. I have swollen ankles, I'm constantly hungry. You think my nipples don't get sore too? You think I don't need to know the fastest way to the hospital? What do we have here? This is my baby. Really Jan had the baby and Michael wasn't there to mark it. So the baby could be anybody's. Except Michael's. So this is Astird. Astrid. Why didn't you call me? You know, labor just kind of started very suddenly and I could have helped. Birth instructor thought it wasn't a good idea for you to be there. That guy? He had no sense of humor and I proved him wrong in so many ways. You have no idea what I've been through. No, I don't! So, let's I'm sorry, I thought today at the baby shower would be a good time for the two of you to meet. Can I hold her? Yes, yes you can. You know, I think, just leave her in the car seat. I love babies. I think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways. I try to pick up and hold a baby every day, if possible, because it nourishes me. It feeds my soul. Babies are drawn to me, and I think it's because they see me as one of them. But cooler. And with my life put together a little bit. If a baby were president, there would be no taxes, there would be no war. There would be no government, and things could get terrible. It actually, probably it would be a better screenplay idea than a serious suggestion. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the office: As trid. trid Levinson. Hi! Astrid, this is everybody, look. This is your family. You're gonna know them for the rest of your life. Well Well, he may not be here. Say hello! OK, here we go. Lion King! Michael, Michael! That's that's too high. I'll take that. Come on, let's get our shower on. Conference room, choppity chip chop. Are you OK? You seem kind of I'm fine, weirdo. Such an HR weirdo. Try not to suck all the air out of there when you walk in. Ready to play some games? Let's do it! The baby's already been born. So we had games planned but the baby ruins all of them. No, the baby doesn't ruin anything Kevin, OK? The baby multiplies the fun. Let's just do what you were going to do. Who wants to guess when the baby will be born? All right, how about some presents? I want to see some presents. I got this so I can write down for thank-you notes. Thank you. That's very sweet. Whatta we got? We all chipped in and got you this stroller. Thank you. She already has a stroller. This is way worse than the stroller she came with. She's got an Orbit, that's a 1200$ stroller. OK, what else? on my whole bomb shelter. For that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible. Being good isn't always easy No matter how hard I try When he started sweet-talking to me He'd come and tell me everything is all right He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right. Can I get away again tonight The only one Hey you! Hey! You busy? Doing laundry for the first time in like a month. OK, you gotta hear this. So, Jan's shower is going on right now, she's singing Son of a Preacher Man Can't hear anything, everyone's just staring at her. there's like machines going. The song is about losing your virginity next to a church, and guess what, she's been singing for the last 20 minutes! I can't hear anything! OK, well you know what, I just call me later. OK. I'm not frustrated. Even if I were in Scranton, Jim and I would have days like this. We're just a little out of sync. You know, that's all. Great. I washed my lipstick. How well I remember The look that was in his eyes Stealing kisses from me on the sly Taking time to make time Telling me that he's all mine Learning from each other's knowing Looking to see how much we've grown. And the only Don't hit the fence. My child! Don't get stuck on the barbed wire! Playtime is over! So Jan, tell my intended about the miracle of childbirth. Actually, I had a tub birth. And it was really quite amazing. You gave birth in a tub? It's a really nice transition from womb to world, you know, kind of like a big womb. So you're in the tub with everything? Yeah, the afterbirth floats. Must be like the tide at Omaha Beach. It's actually really hygienic, Creed. I'm done. Me too. This is the birth story. It was beautiful. It was beautiful. This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. And I should have been there. I should have been there to witness this. I could have helped. I know you're sad about this. And I wish that I, but Would it help if you held Astrid for just a little bit? I'm just going to lie down for 2 minutes. I'm exhausted, so Remind me to talk to you about Astrid's 529. Wake me in 20. I usually love babies, but when I held Astrid I just felt shortchanged. Could you take Sure. Just for a sec. Hey guys. What's up, Mike? I need some advice from one baby daddy to another. You, a baby daddy? I, a baby daddy. When you first became a baby daddy, did you have an immediate connection with that baby? Like, the first time that you held it, did you find that with your baby baby? Hell yeah. You know why? 'Cause that was my baby. I just saw this baby daddy You should stop calling yourself  baby daddy . Why, Darryl? Because I'm quote white quote unquote? Because you're not a daddy, and it's not your baby. Feel connected to his baby over there? It's That's different. You feel connected to this? That's not a baby. You want to hold me, to see how you feel? Could I? No. I was just catching up on my sleep. I can imagine. Where's Astrid? I think she's on a sales call. On a what? More paper! She's just on a coffee break. That's funny. She's with Angela. That's good. Now, I need you to I need it to look up here. Get the baby to look up here, ready? Look at my finger. Look. Come on, up here! Look up here! Your hand's in it. What? Sorry. What are you doing? What's going on? Excuse me. We're taking a picture. She's nature's bounty. You don't flash around a newborn baby. Don't you know that? Michael, I need your help. I was just going to I was going to talk to Holly, about her hygiene. She smells like old tomatoes and dirt. Come on. I like to call this the bumper test. Sure you can't stay a little longer? No, you know what? I really have to go. All right, everybody, we're leaving. Jan and Astrid are leaving. You know what, where is the stroller that I came in with? I took the liberty of putting it in your trunk. Thanks, Dwight. You know what? There is There is one more thing that you can do for me. Don't date Holly. That's I hate her. God! Why would you even ask me to I mean, not that it matters, 'cause I don't, but wha All right. Fine. Thanks for the baby shower. It was great. And I'll see you soon. All right. You still gonna be mean to me? You wanna go out? Yes. I didn't feel much when I held Astrid, but I got a good feeling from Holly. Hey, it's Jim. Leave a message. Hey, this is Pam. Leave a message. Hey, it's me. It is I figured I'd catch you walking to your car, but You must be out or something. I'll leave a message. Is it me, or are we just a little off today? I guess this is just one of those days. It'll get better. Hope you didn't have any major laundry issues. I finished my laundry. Got all my socks. Nothing like that time that crazy guy pushed you. Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you? Remember we went shopping the next day to buy me a washer and dryer? Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat. Now, I'm just trying to help you, Beesly. Be safe. You're probably upset that I'm even at a Laundromat right now. But, don't worry, I'm being safe. And I'm headed home. I'm headed to my dorm. Not home. Wish you were home. Anyway Anyway I miss you. I miss you.
