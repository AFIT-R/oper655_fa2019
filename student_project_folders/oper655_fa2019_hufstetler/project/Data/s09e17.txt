Hold it! New glasses. Dwight, what a ridiculous, fancy clown you are. I am dressed according to the Schrute codes of mourning. My aunt Shirley has died. Oh, Dwight, I'm so sorry. Were you guys close? I would say that she raised me, but let's not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother. My actual mother was very cold and distant. I'd say she was the closest thing I had to an aunt. My condolences. Keep them! Okay. Now, what do we got in these two pails? In keeping with Schrute custom, I will either invite you to Saturday's funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face, or I will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil. What color is it? It looks pretty black. Yep. Acidic all right. Oh, thank God. Excuse me? Oh, I'm so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. It's just I have a personal training session. Okay, that's not-- I get red dirt. Nobody is getting red dirt. I should've kept my mouth shut. We're not even that close. I've only known Dwight Time is a son of a bitch. I'm sure-- I'm sure she's in a better place. I really hope so. Okay, now this is crazy. You can't make a dirtball-- I miss her so much. Okay. You know? Aah!  There's a bright golden haze   on the meadow   a bright golden haze on the meadow  Ziek's here. Ziek! Hey, Dwight. Mose, mom says hi. Hi to mom. You going? Will there be ghosts there? Get in the sidecar. Get in the sidecar. Get in the sidecar. You get in the sidecar. Get-- What are you doing here? You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face. Oh, yeah. Who is that? Jeb, my brother. You have a brother? Mm-hmm. I didn't really see a better parking spot. Oh! Look what I did. It's a rental. You wanna go in? No, you do! You wanna go in? You wanna go in? I'll put you in there. Okay, I'll put you-- Here we go. Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Oh! Oh, gosh. Hey, moonface. Nice to see those shiny little Chinese eyes of yours. Who's this guy? Bad. Hi, all! Why are you here, Todd? Okay, let's get right to it, I guess. My name is Todd Packer, and I am in recovery. I'm working the steps. I'm on step eight of Alcoholics Anonymous, step nine of Narcotics Anonymous. I'm here to make amends. I've been hard to deal with over the past years. Kind of a jerk. I know it. I don't need you to accept my apology, but I'd love it if you did. Packer, we accept. Actually, they have a specific way I need to do this, and I have to go through examples of stuff. Okay, uh, where to begin? Hey Pam-Pam and her pam-pams. Well, I have said some crude things about those. But they are beautiful, and I guess that's why I acted out. Pam, I'm sorry I objectified you and personified your breasts. Sorry, guys. Oh, boy. I have not been nice to you. Phylly, I'm sorry for the things I said about your size to your face, behind your back, and in the form of drawings. Actually, that goes to all you double XLs. Stanley, Kevin this kid in a few years. Todd, you're just saying insults in the form of an apology. Why can't I just be nice? Truth is I really like you guys. I really do. Okay, the apology's just half of it. The big thing is making amends, and that's why I brought these. I went out to the Steamtown mall, and I got you all cupcakes from that place Nipples. Think it's called Nibbles. Ha. The mind sees what it wants to, huh? Ohh there you go. Hey, hey, guys. Wait. Before we accept these cupcakes, I think we need to have a conversation privately in the conference room. Don't eat the cupcake. We are here today to join this woman on the ground. Man is born of woman, and his life is full of turmoil. It's crap soil. Nothing's gonna grow here. It doesn't matter. It's a cemetery. Yeah, well, I'm saying it's garbage soil, that's all. Well, the only thing we're planting here is dead bodies. That's fine, 'cause they're not gonna grow. Well, thank God they're not, because we don't wanna make zombies. Good. I agree. Don't worry about it. You won't get any. Would the family care to say something? You had black hair and then gray hair. You were the aunt to my cousins. Most of your life, you were 5'4 . At the end, you were 5'1 . They're a descriptive people. I see you started without me. You were late, so what am I supposed to do? Hi, Fanny. Hey. How are you? Who is that? Dwight's sister. Dwight has a sister? Yeah. She's beautiful. Blech. Hello, little man. Haven't seen you in a few years. Wha-- what is this-- oh, God. What'd he-- Henry. Dwight. I see Esther's back in town. Hi, Dwight. Hi, Esther. Nice of you to come today. This was on the way. We're going into town after. I need yarn. Well, if you can snap two chicken necks with a single motion, why use two motions to slaughter those chickens? We're at a funeral. There's a funeral going on here. Okay. Okay. Anyone mention her height? Yep. Land size? Shirley, at 1,600 acres, you have the largest farm in the area, sharing borders with six other farms including my own farm and your nephew Dwight's. Okay. So let's get it going. Would you want to do the honors? Oh, right, uh you know, I-I don't think we have to do this. We Schrutes don't need some Harvard doctor to tell us who's alive and who's dead. But there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers. And when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins, we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead out of kindness. That's it for me. I don't think we should eat Packer's cupcakes. We can't give him the satisfaction. I agree. Even though that place has a way of making those cupcakes so they're dense but they're also really fluffy. We can't let him buy our forgiveness with cupcakes. He was awful to us. And he still is. How much is a cupcake, Is that the price of our dignity? I never forget a number. Names, in one ear and out the other. Places, nope. Faces, that's rich. But numbers I have a gift. I guess that's why I'm an accountant. Hey, man, I don't think we've met. I'm Clark. Oh, I'm Todd. Oh, sorry for calling you a fat little runt earlier. You didn't actually say that. No? No. Wow! I'm in this mode now where I'm apologizing for thoughts that are in my head. Hmm. Hey! I have a crazy feeling that you are really gonna like this. Maybe we should eat the cupcakes. Haven't we done enough to Packer? I mean, we sent him down to Florida on a prank, and you did fire him. I did. I did, yes. And it was purely political. He did nothing wrong. Would any of you be saying any of this if the cupcakes were from Supermart? Do they even have a bakery anymore? They do. It's awful! And it's getting worse every day. So it really is just about the cupcakes. Wow, you're right. It is just about the cupcakes. So we're all agreed no one touches those cupcakes? Okay. Okay. Packer can go to hell. Thank you for coming to my funeral. As I gaze at life's big sunset, I can't help but wonder where it all went wrong. You've all disappointed me greatly. Fanny, a single mama in the city. Thank you. Jeb, a street pusher. After I left the army, I bought a nine-acre worm farm from a Californian. Turns out,  worm  means something else out there, and I am now in the business of pain management. Or the smoking of pain management. I can't stand the fact that Jeb is a pot farmer. He could've grown anything. Anything in the world. He used to talk about growing a peanut-grape hybrid. One plant, one sandwich. We can't just sit by and watch our family farm disappear. So here are my terms. Dwight, Fanny, Jeb. If you come back home, I will leave you my farm. So there you have it. Is she crazy? Dwight? Dwight? Buddy? No, no, no. Snap out of it. Dwight! Let's do this. Let's run Aunt Shirley's farm. I'm in. Boom! No, no, no. I'm not moving back here. Are you crazy? Of course you are. Look, I don't wanna be mean or, like, insulting. I know that you like it here. But, Dwight, it's just that farm life lacks a certain sort of sophistication Oh, my God. That Cami and I are drawn to. and I don't know, the men are just-- It's almost like there's a-- a willing ignorance. Yes, I-- thank you for asking me. I actually have written a little bit of poetry. That's crazy. And I was recently published. Which is just-- maybe I have-- yep, I do. Here it is from the, um hartfordwomenslitquarterly.com. A Willing Ignorance by Fanny Schrute. Totally. Yep. The people here are like like a fart. You know what I'm saying? Like a fart. You know what? Let's take a couple of nights and stay here and think about Aunt Shirley's offer. Couple of nights couldn't hurt. Oh, somehow I think a couple of nights could hurt. You will say yes on one. Get ready to say yes. One! Yes! Absolutely! Growing up with Dwight and Mose was not easy. Uh, Dwight was obviously the cool one, and Mose was the visionary, which left me to be the comedian. That doesn't work on me Okay. By the way. It's not-- Quatre, trois, deux, un. Oui on un. Oui, un! Very clever. Oui! Okay. Oui, mais oui. Oui, oui, oui. Oui. Oh, my goodness.  When we arrive, sons and daughters   we'll make our homes on the water   we'll build our--  People underestimate the power of nostalgia. If baseball can use it to get people to care about that worthless sport, then I can use it to get my siblings to care about the farm. Nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses. Second only to the neck.  When we arrive, sons and daughters   we'll make our homes on the water   we'll build our walls aluminum   we'll fill our mouths with cinnamon   now  So I forgot about this old custom. If a man is interested in courting a woman, he may throw the beaks of a crow at her. And then if she's interested in accepting the courtship, she has to destroy the beaks.  When we arrive, sons and daughters   we'll make our homes on the water   we'll build our walls aluminum   we'll fill our mouths with cinnamon  Hey, uh, I just wanna say I'm sorry for screwing you. I'm not sorry about it. I am. It was my rock bottom. Kevin, you can do this. You don't know that. Kevin, um, let's think of something to distract us. Like the movie Skyfall. You loved the movie Skyfall, right? Mm-hmm. James Bond was a spy. Yes, he was a good spy. Yeah. He was the best. James Bond would love this cupcake. Hey, you know what, it was great to see you all again. Take care. I am going through a 12-step program. I'm currently on step zero which is have a shitload of fun. I spent six hours carefully removing the frosting and then layering in a variety of drugs, some legal, some not some laxative, some constipating. You don't fire The Packman and expect to get away with it. Guys, I'm proud of us. I think we did the right thing. Hey! What, Pam? Wait! He's gone. It's just a cupcake now. No, no! It's the principle of the thing. Oh, my God. I forgive him so much. Whoa! Is he choking? Kevin? Oh, that was fantastic. Is it dangerous to take the eggs in front of them? Yes, very. You really need to stand back. 'Cause these are killer chickens. I was just asking you something I didn't know. Which is fine, and you learned something. But it was kind of a stupid question, so you're gonna get made fun of a little bit. Are we gonna eat these today? If you want. Is that a guillotine? This? No. That'd be cool though. It's for milking. That's a cow? Did you just ask me if this was a cow? What are you doing now? Come here. Come on. Grab a teat with each hand. Sit down. There you go. Squeeze from top to bottom. Really pull, use some muscle. Draw the milk out. All right, going all right? I don't know. Well, is the udder hot? Is the milk clumpy? I don't know any of that. Okay, you suck at this. Gimme those teats. Didn't your father teach you anything? I never met him. Good morning, Erin. Hey. Hey, everybody. Um, I decided to eat my cupcake. I thought about it last night. I talked to Jim, I talked to my sister, and I think that as long as Todd Packer doesn't know, it's okay. I don't care what you do, Pam, just please stop making noise. Phyllis! Packer laced the cupcakes. No! Did you get diarrhea or were you stoned? Some of us got both. Oh, my God! Is everyone okay? Last night, I got out all of my old dolls and played with them on the living room floor. Then I ordered ten American Girl outfits on line. It was thousands of dollars. Well, count yourself lucky, Phyllis. I got the toilet. Me too. I went Christmas caroling in March, and I fertilized some bushes along the way. So not my best night. But not my worst night. What did you do, Andy? Last night! Oh, God, um I don't know. Noth-nothing, really. Kevin? Why would you ask me? No, I'm not a-- I just-- I don't know. Oh gosh, I actually-- it is hard to recall. Um, pretty normal night. My night was just like that Yup. Okay. Meaning normal. Yeah, I didn't see you last night at all. Nope, I did not see you either. Wow! He is officially the worst human being. Ah! But Kevin, that's-- Yeah, no, I understand, Pam. I understand. No. Ohh. So that's it. I just wanted to make amends. Wow. That's big of you, man. Takes a lot of courage. Ooh. Red velvet. I should apologize too. It's okay. I'm over it.  When we arrive, sons and daughters  Ooh, this is no nine-acre worm farm. This is a beast. Whoever's managing this thing is gonna have a hell of a job. Mm-hmm. Not it. Not it. It. If your kid doesn't put in some farm time, or he's gonna stay like that. All right, fine.
