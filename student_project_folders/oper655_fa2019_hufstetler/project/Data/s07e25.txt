It's a beautiful morning  at Dunder Mifflin--    Or as I like to call it  Great Bratton.    Keep it running.    Do I love being manager?    I love my kids.  I love real estate.    I love ceramics.  I love my job.    I-I love wrestling.    Find out what language this is.    Okay. Team building.    On this side of the room,  Stanley, Phyllis, Jim,    Ted, Elroy.    On this side of the room,  Pam, Meredith, Phyllis, Creed    He never called a meeting.    BoBody.  BoBody.    What does the first  b   stand for?    What are we doing?    We're making acronyms.  Okay!    What does the first  b   stand for?    Business!    I like it!    Business.    Good, Kevin!    All right, the  o     We need a new manager.        Your paper experience  is very interesting.    Do you think you could  use that experience    to inform decisions here?    Absolutely, I--  Yes.    In fact, I actually have  a three-step plan    that I believe could effectively  double your profits.    Really?  Yeah.    What is it?    Nice try.    Uh  I'm sorry.    W-what is your  three-step plan?    Well, I mean, I can't  just hand you my plan.    I mean, if you guys  give me the job,    then-- Then you'll get  the plan.    Welllt's an interview,    and we don't know  that you really have the plan.    I'm not gonna just make up  that I have a plan.    I got a plan.  Believe me, you guys want it.    You're in paper, right?    How do we know that  if you don't    You could just be saying it  to get the job.    I guess I could be if I was    Who would do that?    How about this.    Why don't you give us  a part of the plan,    and that way  we know you have it.    Tell you what.    I'll give you  part three of part two.    Not gonna give you  a whole part.    Okay.    Color-code  said document. TM.    Did you just trademark that?  W-what?    That's a verbal trademark.  That's an agreement.    We are the search committee    Hand-picked by our CEO    and tasked to find  this branch's new manager.    Not everyone we meet  will be good,    but someone's  bound to be, right?    And to be honest,    I think a lot of  the decent candidates    are right here in house.    So I'm not too worried.    But I'm really excited  to spend a lot of time    with Toby and Gabe.    Did you know  that Gabe's last name was Lewis?    I had no idea.    Good morning.    Morning.  Good morning.    Good morning.    Did you have a nice drive in?    I did.    I have a solid  relationship with Jo,    the company's owner.    I have management experience.    I have a good friendship  with Jim,    the head of  the search committee.    And it doesn't hurt that I'm    * Black! *    It's good.  I really hope you get it.    The manager job?  Naw, I'm barely interested.    I just can't not go for it,  you know.    It's not the Bernard way.    We give it the old college try,    and then in defeat,  we show grace.    StillI'd really  like to see this office    with you in the boss's chair.    Don't even    You in the boss's chair!  Eeehhh! No.    In my family, you don't  really go out and get things.    If you want something,  you write it on a list    and then the housekeeper  goes out and gets it    on wednesdays and Fridays.    SoI don't know.    I guess you could say  this job is on my list and    We'll see what rosa  comes back with.    Did you hear anything?    OhI'm sure  they'll let us know    when they get the results.    It turns out that Erin was born    in the basic time and region  that I gave away a child.    So Phyllis might be my mom.    I mean,  the chances are tiny, but    Yeah.  But probably not.    I mean, it was  a big year for babies.    Porky's had come out.  Yeah.    I'm sure I was just  another porky's baby.    But why not find out?  Yeah.    Should you really be  so blatant about that?    They won't make me manager,    and I won't settle  for anything less.    I've gone about as far  as I can here.    That's obvious.    Time to take my talents  elsewhere.    Are you really gonna  apply for work    at Scranton Breadworks?    Bread is the paper  of the food industry.    You write your sandwich on it.    Can you do any better  on salary?    Unfortunately,  that range is set at corporate.    What about mileage  when I use my car?    I mean,  gas ain't cheap, you know.    We think that    How 'bout 27 and, uh    When I make long-distance  calls    will they be monitored,  or is it on the honor system?    Okay.    How odd!    A very unusual phone call  from the senator's office.    The senator wants me  to have lunch with him    at the botanical gardens.    The botanical gardens    Scranton's hidden gem.    Don't eat any berries  you don't recognize.    How will your experience  selling refinery equipment    translate to our  smaller scale here?    You don't work in sales,  do you?    UhHuman resources.    You see,  I sit across from a man    I see his face.  I see his eyes.    Now, does it matter  if he wants $100 of paper    or $100 million  of deep-sea drilling equipment?    Don't be a fool.    He wants respect.    He wants love.    He wants to be younger.  He wants to be attractive.    There is no such thing    as a product.    Don't ever think there is.    Ere is only sex.    Everything is sex.    You understand  that what I'm telling you    is a universal truth, Toby.    Yes.    Okay, I-I--    I amI'm almost  a little concerned    that you might be overqualified  for the position.    Do you, um  Do you think that you are?    Do I look like someone  who--    Who'd waste my own time?    No.    Can y--    You are a man  of great confidence.    Could you speak  a little more to that    and what the role of confidence    would be in a dialogue    with a subordinate?    Will you be heard?    Will you have a voice?    Will I steamroll over you?    Do you feel heard  right now, Jim?    Do you have a voice right now?    You can answer me.  Yes.    That was your choice, not mine.    The fallacy is that it is  up to the steamroller.    It is up to the object    Whether it will be  flattened or not.    And I can tell just from  the small interaction    we've had already,    you won't be flattened  by anybody.    Do you agree with me, Jim?    Yes.  Yes, you do.    He creeps me out.    But I think  he might be a genius.    Good luck, Darryl.    Thank you.    Think about it.    What other mammal,  besides humans,    drinks the milk  of another mammal?    I mean, you don't see a bear  drinking raccoon milk.    So this is cool.  I think we make a good fit.    Oh. Uh, we haven't  started the interview yet.    Were you--  Were you joking?    UhYes.  I was.    Little joke.    So how would you go about  settling interpersonal conflicts    within the office?    I thought that was your job.    Well, it's one of my strengths,    but it's the manager's job.    Well, for instance,  how did you deal with it    when two warehouse guys  got into a fight?    I'll answer that, Jim.    I would use it  as an opportunity to teach    Uh, about actions  and consequences    of actions.    Who's that?    So I think all we need  is a resume,    and we'll be good, right?    I-I just thought  you knew me.    Yeah, it's no big deal.    Just something  that looks like that.    Cool.    Let me    Cool.    Did, uh, you just interview?    Oh. Unfortunately, yes.    W-what do you mean?    That business  can't attract anyone.    It's awful up there.    Those people seem like  they're in prison    waiting out life sentences    in a  Dying industry.    Place must be horrible.    I don't know  if I want this job.    Well, if I get this job offer,    then I know  that I'm gonna take it.    And if I take it, I know  that I'm never gonna quit.    And then 25 years  are gonna go by, and    I'm gonna die here.    What makes you feel qualified  to judge a place    after a mere interview?    What are you doing?    Stop trying to figure me out.    I just did.  You can't.    It's done.  No, it's not.    I know you now.  I know your nature.    You don't know me-- You don't  know anything about me.    I'm done.  Get out of my head.    Not worth continuing.  Stop trying to figure me out.    Do you even know  anything about paper?    How it's made?    I saw an episode  on how they make paper    on sesame street.    Get out.    I'm gonna prevent inferior men    from sullying my place of work    with their weak,  passionless leadership.    Do you see my hat?  No?    That's because I just  threw it in the ring.    You guys pay for relocation,  though, right?    Well, why would you need  relocation    if you already live  in Scranton?    Well, I'd wanna move  further away, you know?    JustDon't want any chance    of running into my coworkers  outside the office.    Can I ask why  you're leaving your current job?    I'm leaving my other job    because they were all  Jerks.    Really.  You know, all of them.    You had your jerk wads  and your jerk offs, so    Just between the wads  and the offs,    I just--  I had to get outta there.    Is this a bad time  to be doing this?    I'm having a bad time.    I'm sorry.    I-if we did something  to upset you,    I-I'm sure it was  inadvertent.    Wait.    Oh, why did I believe  that weirdo in the lobby?    These are the nicest people  I ever met.    Thank you.    It's gorgeous, Angela.    Yeah, I actually know  about nice rings,    and it is gorgeous.  OhWow.    It's a little flashy.  I mean, what am I    Naomi judd?    Tell us the freaking story!  Yeah, tell us the story.    Okay.  He took me to the replica    of Monet's Japanese bridge.    And then he put this flower  behind my ear,    which normally I would hate,    'cause it's so civil rightsy.    Then he got down  on one knee and he said,     will you be  a senator's wife?     Oh! He talked about himself  in the third person?    Yes, Pam.    Not everyone is as informal  as you and Jim.     Oh, hey, Pam, dude, whatever.    Wanna marry me?     That's not accurate.    Then I saw flashes.  Reporters were there.    They always find us.  And everyone was crying.    Even his aide.    Angela's engaged to a gay man.    As a gay man, I'm horrified.    As a friend of Angela's,  horrified.    As a lover of elegant weddings,    I'm a little excited.    But overall, horrified.    Andy?    You all set?    Okay, guys.  It's time.    It's pep talk time.  Tell me what I need to hear.    Are you sure  this is a good idea?    I hate to see you disappointed.    I think Andy  should be the boss.    He's just so great.    If I'm being objective,  then Darryl, of course.    So Andy,  what improvements would you make    as office manager?  For starters, I really think    we can streamline communication  around here.    Whoa. That's  a very heavy accusation    to level against Toby.    I wasn't a-accusing--  Well, Toby's in charge    of human resources.    That would include  communication.    I think that Toby's  done a fine job.    Right. I-I-I really wasn't  trying to insult a-anyone.    I didn't think you were.    I have two relationships  with Andy.    I have a personal relationship,    and I have a professional  relationship.    Personally, yeah,  I think he's a rat    and I think he's responsible    for the demise of my  relationship with Erin.    Professionally    He broke up the happiest  couple in this office.    How many windows are there  in New York City?    What?  Critical thinking.    Common on-the-spot question  asked in an interview.    Okay. UhLet me think.  Are you counting car windows?    No. How far away  is the sun?    Uh, 93 million Miles.    Is it?  Yeah.    And the diameter of the sun  is 870,000 miles,    which makes it 109 times  wider than the earth    and 333,000 times  heavier than the earth.    Shut up about the sun.    Shut up about the sun!    I am unhappy with the confusing    and, at times, confrontational  nature of that meeting.    I wanted it to go better.    I wanted it to go better!    Yes, there used to be  a paper clip    that would pop up and say,     looks like you are writing  a letter or resume.    Would you like help?     I believe his name was  Clippy.    First of all, I wanna thank you    for your years  of patronizing our company.    I've got some bad news.    We're going out of business.    Saving face.    Yep, yep.    I understand that.    Basically everything's  falling apart here.    How is this on me?    Hang up.    Corporate needs you  to find the differences    between this picture  and this picture.    Intel has told us  there are at least seven.    Okay. I already see one.  Gimme.    Okay.    They're the same picture.    Well, I manage my department,    and I've been doing that  for several years now.    And, God, I've learned a lot  of life lessons along the way.    Your department's  just you, right?    Yes, Jim, but I am not  easy to manage.    Great.  Um, can we just    What was that?  We just have    a lot of serious candidates  to get through today, so    Am I not a serious candidate?    What do you want me to say?    I mean, there's a line  of qualified people out there.    We have a video CV  from England.    Are we all just gonna  pretend to--    okay. Um    What are your weaknesses?    I don't have any, asshole.    I want an interview.    How's the family?  Good.    Good? Are they good?  Yeah.    What's your daughter's  name again?    Peepee?    Peepa.  Peepa. How is she?    Great.  Great!    Oh, that's great.    We never were very good  at smalltalk, were we, Jim?    No.  Now, listen--    You're not getting  an interview, Dwight.    The whole point  of this search committee process    is to prevent hiring  someone like you ever again.    Okay. I know why  you're saying that, Jim.    I really do.  But think of it this way.    The hand that reaches  from the grave    to grip your throat    is the strong hand  you want on the wheel.    Okay. That's vivid.  Now, I'm gonna make you    an offer, okay?    You even do so little  as grant me an interview,    I will guarantee you  your dream work life, okay?    You roll in at 10:00 AM    to your own private  reserved parking spot,    pick up your daily free coffee  from Dwight's caffeine corner,    unlimited sex breaks  for you and Pam.    Yikes.  Erin will eat garbage    for your entertainment.    Wow. You know how I like  taking bribes.    Ha ha!  But unfortunately,    jo also took the job  away from you    because she doesn't  trust your judgment.    So how would that look for me    if I recommended you?    Fine.    I'll do it without you.  You'll regret this.    Okay.    Let me get that for you.    Thank you.  Okay.    Pam, I think Robert is gay.    The senator?    He was married before,  and he has a kid.    So--  And don't say that thing    about how lots of gay guys  have kids.    I have a very strong suspicion.    Did you see him at a bathhouse?    What bathhouse?    The windowless building  by the Baskin Robbins.    What?    Forget it. I'm never  gonna know what goes on there.    My friend at the Scranton blade    is totally plugged into  these matters.    You're in the gay mafia.    You're thinking of  another group--    Much wealthier, much older.  You sound ignorant.    You guys, um  Talking senator?    No.  No.    Why would we be talking  about the senator?    'Cause he's totally gay.    How do I know  that Robert is gay?    He  liked  my Facebook photos    at 3:00 in the morning.    Name-- David Brent.  Occupation-- Inspirer.    Status-- None of your business.    Young, free,  and single, though.    Thanks for asking.    Hey, you're looking  for a new boss, yeah?    Someone to tell  a bunch of discontented,    under-encouraged drones  what to do every day.    Is that it? Oh.  Our out-of-touch powers that be.    Want me to fire them?  They don't see things your way?    Then I am that dude.  Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye.    Get some other corporate suit  to lay down the law.    What?  You've changed your mind?    You're now looking for  a leader of men?    Ipso factoWomen too.    When do I start?    Do you know what it took  to get Bob to notice me?    I waited in his office  every morning    wearing nothing but  kitty cat ears.    I did that every day  for two weeks.    And on the tenth day,  he walked in.    He was naked too,  except a dog nose.    Guess what we did then?  I don't think I can do that--    Bestiality.  Yeah.    That's not my personality.    If my daughter  were asking me    Yes?    I would say  if you want someone--    If you really want them--    Go get them.    I do really want him.    So, uh  Here you go.    Great.  Hope it's all right.    I'm sure it's fine.    The guy who was  in here earlier,    interviewed after me  How'd he do?    Howard cline?    That's not  who I'm talking about.    Oh. Deshaun Williams.    Yes. How did he do?    He's an amazing man.  He's a rhodes scholar.    He invented an app  that invents apps.    Fantastic kisser.    Common, man.  I'm being serious.    It's no joke.  Darryl, we all know you.    Your interview is not nearly  as important as the other guy's.    First I'll take down    the cubicle walls.  But there aren't--    Symbol of transparency.    There'd be no titles.    Everyone has the same job.    Same goes for me.    I'd take your job,  but I'd reject the title.    A little unspecific.    Everyone would be known    for their accomplishments.    That's very interesting.    UmI feel like  there might be a conflict there,    and if a conflict did arise,  how would that be dealt with?    Oh!  Yeah.    Scratch everything from before.    I tell you what I'd do.  Go the other way.    More cubicles.    More division.    Everyone is somebody's boss,    and that person can fire  the person below them.    And once a month  the lowest-performing person--    Bye-bye.    How would you compare  like an accountant and HR?    Well, I'll tell you how,  shall I?    I'll tell you how.  Okay.    By splitting the difference.    Just--just somewhere  in the middle.    I think that's probably all    We need to hear from--    Zen office.    Thought of that?  That's what I'd do.    Everyone takes their shoes off  before they come in, okay?    There'd be no desks.  You just sit on the floor.    That's very--  You've got a thai woman    out in the back--  Sockee.    Okay.  Sockee.    That's not--  Sockee is her name, okay?    She's administering massage,  all right, if you need it.    If you don't, whatever.  Just talk to her.    She's a person.    Either way, 50 minutes of that,    and you    You are cracking to go.    Is there a frontrunner?  You know what?    They all just sort of blend  together after a while.    Well, there must be  someone who stands out.    No, not at all.    In fact, I'm not even  taking it seriously.    I think at the end of the day,    I'm just gonna pick  a name out of the hat.    The hell you will!    I worked for the last boss  for 15 years.    According to my doctor,  I don't have another 15 years    if I wanna keep up the same  dietary and sexual lifestyle,    which I intend to.    Oh, no, Stanley.  You'll live forever.    My next boss  will be my last boss.    He'll be at my funeral.    So I would appreciate it if  you would take this seriously.    You pick a crappy boss,    you're responsible  for my crappy life.    Okay, everybody.  I was just making a joke.    I am taking it seriously.  I promise.    Are you?    Little advice?    Take a day off  from the whole Jim shtick.    Try caring about something.    You might like how it feels,  James.    Hey, honey. Oh, lord.  Take all this.    All right.  Here.    Oh.  Jim.    Did you hear stern  this morning?    No. Was he good?  AhRobin was good.    She's always good.  Keeps him on his toes.    It's Howard's show, though.    Whose is this?    Darryl Philbin.    Oh. Very nice to see  a familiar face on top.    Ah, a little long, aren't we?  Four pages?    Is this the same Darryl Philbin    who's had two jobs in ten years  at one company?    Yes, thanks to you  who promoted me    after we, uhlnterfaced.     Coordinated and implemented  receipt, storage,    and delivery of over        Paper material, ma'am.    Paper material?    Pieces of paper.    Jo. May I speak  to you for a second?    Or what?  You gonna shoot me?    Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha    Oh, I enjoy laughing  at my mistakes.    Because I've learned  so much from them.    I'd like to be interviewed  for the position.    I'll interview you right now.    Okay.  Question one.    Ever shot a gun in the office?    It's complicated    Yeah, but seelt's not.    I don't think  we should tell her.    Angela went a whole day  without telling me    I had lettuce in my teeth.  Screw her.    I'm a woman.  I would want to know.    Yeah. You gotta know.    Okay. But if Angela  can get a gay man to marry her,    maybe I could get  a lesbian to marry me. Huh?    Huh? Huh?  That's hot.    You have met a lesbian  in real life, right?    You know, this probably is  her last chance at a family.    She does seem happy.    You're right.  You're right.    She seems happy.  We don't tell her.    We don't tell her.  Okay.    Excuse me, Ms. Bennett,  may I have a word?    Okay.    UhCan it be in private?    Don't worry.  It's not about you.    As minority executive,    I think it's my responsibility  to let you know    that Gabe is gross.    I don't think it's professional    that he was sleeping  with the receptionist,    and then when Erin dumped him  so that she could be with Andy,    he became a total  crazy stalker psycho.    Welcome to Scranton, Jo,    land of a thousand problems  only you can fix.    Oh, for God's sake.    He's texting me his resume  one line at a time.    These are costing me    I'm roaming!    Get me our biggest client  on the phone    right this instant.    Who is our biggest client?    Uh, just put him through to me.    Okay.    Hello, this is  The client.    It's Creed.    Fyi. I'm starting  my own paper company.    Looking to poach some chumps.  You in?    Yes.  Cool!    Let's keep this on the qt,  okay?    I, uh, don't want you  to be a dead mammajamma.    Great.  All right, thank you.    Thank you.  Bye-bye.    Jo, you have one more  candidate.    He's a burn victim.    He's all messed up.    I can tell him  to get lost if you want.    No. Send him in.    Who is this?    I have no idea.  Oh, I know this guy.    Hello, Mr. Souvenier.    Mr. Jacques Souvenier?    Nice to meet you.  It says here you're French?    So you worked  at your last job for 15 years    as assistant  to the regional manager.    Assistant regional manager.    Assistant  to the regional manager.    Assistant regional manager.  What is it?    Assistant regional manager.    Oh. That's my mistake.  Sorry about that.    The last paper company  you worked for    burned to the ground?     All because they wouldn't  hire a manager    who lived and breathed paper.     That's a travesty.    I wanna talk to Dwight Schrute  for a second.    I wanna ask him a question.    Get Dwight.    If he isn't here  in 60 seconds    Wait, wait!  No. Stop, stop.    Jo    It's me.  I'm Dwight.    No.    No. Wait. But--    I mean, you're Dwight  and then    He's the--    Yeah.    Very unprofessional, Jacques.    Or should I say Dwight?    Let's just say I had  hired this Jack Souvenier.    Then what?    I would have dressed  this way every day,    legally changed my name,  learned French sign language,    shown up, and been the best  damn branch manager    you'd ever seen.    All that for this job.    Yes.    That's [Bleep.] Crazy.    Get outta here.    What a nut job.    This guy was good,  although he did keep saying    that he needed two weeks off  right at the beginning    for a trip to the Finger Lakes.    Seriously, every five minutes  he was like,     hey, just making sure the  Finger Lakes thing is clear.     Okay. It's fun to talk  about the rejects,    but, uh  Who's got ya excited?    Finger Lakes guy is good.    Darryl is also very good.    Who's this fellow?  Went to Cornell.    What's wrong with him?  How much time do you have?    Sales ability--none.    See sales ability.    And that's your unbiased  opinion.    Yes, it is.  So it's not relevant    that he took the receptionist  away from ya.    Aw, Jo.  Jo, I'm disappointed in you.    Some people let personal  things into the work--    is she with him?  Because I-I thought that--    Gabe!  Ohh!    You got all close  to these people,    got involved in their lives.    Let's get ya back to Florida.    We'll figure out  something for ya.    That sounds like a promotion.    It's not.    Let's get Kelly in here  to take his place.    UmWhy Kelly?    'Cause Gabe's tall and weak.  She's short and strong.    I'm doing an opposites thing.    Okay.    How'd my girl Nelly do?    Oh. I didn't know  you knew her.    She didn't mention it?  No.    Integrity move.  I like it.    Yeah, uh, she also  gave me reason to think    that maybe she wasn't  a good fit.    Well, I'm not saying  you must hire her.    If you find someone  who's clearly a fit, then fine.    Just make sure  they fit real good.    No more manager turnover.  Don't mess this up, Jim.    And give Dwight an interview.    I like a little bit of crazy.    Ah!  Erin, what are you doing?    I've been turned into a puppet.    Okay.    Look at the puppet.  Hi, puppet.    Who are you?    I went to drop off  the FedEx forms,    and an evil witch named Angela  turned me into a puppet!    Yeah.    Low blow, puppet.    And there's only one thing  that can change me back    into a real girl.    It's good.    It's just that  I wish the puppet    would talk more about  the alphabet.    Not for me, but    If any kids are watching.    A, b, and so forth.    You know.    M, N, L, O. P.    F.    I need the most  special thing in the office.    Silence?    A date with  the best salesman    Andy Bernard!    Hey, Erin.  Oh.    Where'd you learn  how to puppet like that?    I've done it all my life--  Listen, I'm really flattered,    but I don't think we should.    Erin's my best friend  in this office,    hands down.    But    When she asked me out,    I just didn't have  that feeling, you know?    Aren't there some things  that you really want to like    but you just can't  seem to like it?    Like madmen or football.    Let's not forget.  Erin chose Gabe over me.    That happened.    I'm not gonna apologize  for getting over herOkay?    I'm sorry.    I would go for someone  who's more    She's great, though.    Stanley,  I won't be able to invite    everyone to the wedding,    because we wanna keep it  to 350.    I'll get over it.  I mean,    we just have to see  how many senators    and members of congress  want to attend    before we can open it up  to regular people.    Pam, you know how you and Jim  did your ironic wedding?    Do you still have the plans    for the dream wedding  that you couldn't afford?    That was our dream wedding.    Niagara falls?    Pregnant?  That was your dream?    Pork medallions?    I hope    You have a very beautiful  wedding, Angela.    All right.    Name.  Dwight Schrute.    Thank you, Mr. Scnoot.  We will let you know.    You have to interview me.  I just did.    The answer to that one question    told me everything  I need to know.    I demand more questions!    All right, guys.  Good day.    A lot of candidates.  Let's discuss.    Okay. If you're not gonna  interview me,    then I'll do it.  Yes.    What will be  your first priority?    I will have seven  first priorities.    Safety, profits,    fostering a community  of self-reliance    and entrepreneurship,    listening,    respect for human life,    bolstering our public image,    and  Getting everyone home on time.    Dwight, let me be Frank.    In an accident  that no one can blame you for,    an antique gun was discharged  while you were acting manager.    How are we ever  to trust you again?    That's a great question.    I am going to institute    a strict no firearms policy  for this office    that extends to myself as well.    Wow. All of my concerns  are disappearing.    Thank you, Dwight.  Thank you.    You'll be hearing from us  shortly, Mr. Schrute,    and I think you're going to  like the call    you're going to receive.    Oh, come on.    I'm just happy  that I got this meeting.    Well, that was quick.    Very, very interesting.    And you know what?  I'm impressed.    He's not a real candidate.  I don't know, Jim,    'cause it makes me think  about something    that my grandfather  used to say, which is that    sometimes the hand  that jumps out of the grave    and grabs you around the throat,    that is the hand  that you want on the wheel.    You took the deal.  Yeah. It was a great deal.    That's not okay.  I don't know.    Dwight seems like  a great leader to me,    and I look forward  to the personal perks    that he promised me privately.    What do you think, Toby?    Well, we could try him out  for a little while.    If it doesn't work out,  you know,    maybe one of us could,  you know, step in    What is happening right now?    Is it true that you're  making Dwight the manager?    No. Why would you  think that?    Well, he and Kelly said,  then they pre-fired me.    Okay.    Okay, guys,  just so you all know,    no decision has been made.    And Dwight is definitely  not the boss.    That is correct.    Actually, Dwight is not  the manager yet.    No, no, no, not-- Not ever,  'cause that's not gonna happen.    Well, it's not entirely  up to you, is it?    Seems to me like someone  is getting a little power mad.    Am I the only one who remembers    what he did  when he was in charge?    I feel like I'm going  a little bit crazy.    Tuna  You're completely sane.    Thank you.  Who do you like for the job?    Is there anyone who maybe    was a little underwhelming  at first    but now seems like a safe    If not slightly unexciting  choice?    Okay. It seems like everybody  has an opinion, so who else?    Anybody?  Do you mean it?    Anybody?  Are you sure?    I suppose I am.    Okay. Well, what do I want  in a manager?    Let me see.    What do I want?    I don't think he meant--    So now anyone gets to talk  at any time?    Go ahead.    What do I want?    I'm looking for someone    who    Everyone is listening to me.    Can I say--  Yes.    I think it should be Darryl.    Okay.  What a surprise.    Minorities sticking together.  Kelly's on your side.    I'm sorry, is that all  you think of me-- A minority?    I am so much more than that.    I am a dancer.  I'm a singer.    I'm a fashion designer.    Whoever it is,  I think they should be lame.    Kind of a nonthreatening,  moderate personality.    I want an outsider.  Perfect.    There are several outside  candidates that we think--    No, I mean an outsider.    Like someone  on the margins of society    who doesn't see things  the way we do,    like a homeless person.  A homeless person.    Really?  A homeless person.    No. You're right, Pam.    Let's just leave them  to the welfare system    and let that handle it.  No, I want you to say    that you think the best person  to be our new manager    is a homeless person.    Let me guess who you want, Pam.    Rachael ray?  The ladies of the view?    I got away with everything  under the last boss,    and it wasn't good for me  at all.    So I want guidance.  I want leadership.    But don't just like  boss me around, you know?    Like lead me.    Lead me  When I'm in the mood    to be led.    I just want for once    a small, professional,  decisive,    well-hung man  in his 40s.    Hey, hey, hey!  Okay, fine.    Uh, the guy with a tiny penis.    Are you happy?  Let's hire that guy!    She may have a point there.    Would a small penis work?    Small to moderate.    Gotta catch a plane.    Oh, hey, Gabe, I'm sorry.    We didn't get you  a cake or anything.    We're gonna miss you.    Oh, well, I'm still the  corporate liaison to the branch.    You are not leaving  without giving me a hug.    Ugh!  Okay, you know what?    You don't need  to make that sound.    I'm sorry.  You were just a lot bonier    than I thought  you were gonna be!    There are plenty of people  who love touching me.    I'm a terrific hugger.    I've been with a bunch of girls    where that's basically  all they wanna do.    I will see you all soon.  Later, man.    Good luck.  We'll miss you.    Good luck at your new job.    Uh, listen up.    Listen up, ladies.    I want the job.    There. I said it.    I'm educated.  I'm capable.    I like all of you,  and I won't make any changes.    I see it.    I see it like I see a Mountain  that I'm standing in front of    and facing and I'm liking.    Yeah.    Andy would be wonderful  as boss.    Erin made a good point.    No. We're not related.  I got the call.    But  I'll tell her some other day.    What about Darryl?    We can all agree  that he's a stand-up guy, right?    Well, let me be clear.  I only speak for myself    and not myself and the senator.    I think we have  some wonderful candidates,    and there is a great  lively debate here.    But let's think about--  No. No.    No. Sorry. We cut Kevin off  for the same thing.    You have to have something  to say if you talk.    Exactly.    Jada. No, no, no.  Jada, what are you do--    Oh. So sorry, guys.    I hope my family  didn't disrupt your meeting.    Daddy, are these the people  who are making you manager?    Maybe, sweetheart.    Single dad.  Challenges.    I don't know  if he'd be a good manager,    but he's a really great dad.    Okay. Shush.  This was a mistake.    Let's go.    It seems like  we all know enough to vote.    Should just vote now?  What? No, no, no.    It's not a vote.  Then what was this all about?    I don't know.    This conversation  really got away from me.    I don't care.  They can just vote.    No, they can't.    That's not how  this is gonna work.    We're going in this room.    We're gonna have a meeting.    We're gonna make  a recommendation to Jo,    and she's gonna give you her  recommendation on Monday, okay?    What the hell happened  out there?    Sometimes you hear people  talking about failing upwards.    I think I'm about to do that.    This job?  Oh, yeah, I'll get it.    Jo's an old friend.    I think  M her best friend.    She's not my best friend.    Every day,  I have a blueberry muffin.    Today I did not have  a blueberry muffin.    Should have had  the blueberry muffin.    Especially considering how  incredibly superstitious I am.    No. I've never been more sure  of anything in my life.    I will be the new boss of    Vance refrigeration.    Honestly, I think I--  I sabotaged myself.    It's like I'm afraid  of being happy.    Case in point    I was supposed to start  another job today.    I will get offered the job.    That's aCall I've received  many times.    The slight  Hopefulness in their voice,    the pregnant pause  while they    Wait to hear my response.    And then  My response.    I want the job.    I really do.    It's just the rest  of my family's    in the Finger Lakes right now.    I'm supposed to be  in the Finger Lakes right now.    I told 'em I was on a hike,  snuck away to do this interview.    I gotta get back pretty soon.  They'll worry.    People disappear  in the Finger Lakes.    I will run this branch    or I will destroy this branch.    OrI don't know.    Something always works out.        You remind me so much  of my fourth biggest client.    Is that right?    I think you two should meet.    Well, okay    Hey, Jordana, patch my ninth    and my fourth biggest client  together.    Hello?  Hello!    Hi, how are ya?  Oh, I'm good!    Don't you just love paper  and things about paper?    Hey! Are you single? This seems  like a love connection to me!    *
