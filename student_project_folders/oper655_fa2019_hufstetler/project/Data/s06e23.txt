Stop it. Stop what? You're talking about me in morse code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you. 'cause I know morse code. Ha! Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time And with our very limited budget, We went and got a nanny and then we nt out And took a class on a very outmoded And very unnecessary form of communication just so We could talk about you in front of you. Yup. That's exactly what we did. It all started when dwight was tapping his foot Against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said,  I will when you lose the baby weight.  Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize. Detonator. Detonator where? Michael! Jim. Are you clicking a detonator? It's a pen. Michael, come on. Get back to work, dwight. Please. Fine. Hey. Tap away. Ooh! Things with donna are so-- Oh-ho-ho! They're going great. I, uh We're just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually andOrally And I am not used to relationships Going this well. I'm actually having trouble focusing on my job. * and I like it * Who enjoys the weekends? Of course. Now the weekend is always great If you have someone, which I do. I have donna. She is hot. She has a pilates butt. But we need to find something to do this weekend Beside have sex. Did I say that? Yes, I did. And the reason you are here is that I need ideas For things that donna and I could do on the weekend. So just shout it out. I have an idea for your weekend. Okay. Let me go back to my desk right now. Okay, you get out of here, big dog. Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas. Stanley got to go. Yeah, well, stanley doesn't help with anything. Come on. Shout 'em out, shout 'em out. Walk around apple orchards. Super romantic. Oh. That's fun. Eel fishing. All right. Curl up with your favorite dvd. You and donna should hit the poconos. They have heart-shaped jacuzzis. Room enough for three. We actually went to the poconos last Tuesday. We headed up there, We went to a little chinese bistro, Um, p.F. Chang's. Wait, why would go all the way to the poconos To p.F. Chang's when we have the great wall in scranton? Because when your super hot girlfriend says,  I wanna go to mount pocono,  You go to mount pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. Tmi. Wait, that's crazy far. Are you sure she's not cheating? You know what, kelly? This is the real world. Not the real world: Scranton. Oh, my god, this is super weird. When ryan had two girlfriends, He used to take me to some diner in hazelton Just so the other girl wouldn't see. Some diner? It was the starlight diner. It's, it's in a life magazine spread About americana. You guys think donna's cheating on me? No. Michael, no. Are you nuts? You had a nice meal with your girlfriend In a lovely place-- And--we had sex too. That is right. Don't make any more of it. How? How what? How do I not make any more of it? You could start by concluding this meeting. All right. And she won't say,  I love you.  Oh, no. How many dates have you been on? Nine dates. I said it on the second date. Mm. That seemsQuick. Even for lesbians. Does she keep her phone locked around you, michael? Does she watch how much she drinks around you, michael? Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before sex? Does she shower aftesex? Does she-- yeah, she does all that. Sorry, dude. No, no-- Michael, do not let your imagination run amok. Run what? Amok. It means, don't let your imagination run out of control. Why didn't you just say that, pam? Michael, do not let your imagination Run out of control. Well, that's easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It's stupid. I live in a fantasy world. You do? Yes, jim, I do. And I can't stay in a relationship That is full of lies and deceit. But you didn't believe any of this was true Five minutes ago. That's what makes it so wrong. Ever since I found out That donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that's what's killing me. Oh, god, that tickles. What did-- I want someone to follow donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator. I think I've got one for you. This is you. How much do you charge? $100 a day, plus expenses. I'll give you $50. Money's no object. Done. I'm just gonna warn you-- And I say this to all my clients-- You might not like what I find. Okay. And you might not like how I find it. Of course. Yeah, that's terrible. Okay, let me get back to you. Hey, stanley. One of my clients just called and said that Their sabre printer started smoking And caught on fire. My doctor told me to cut out hot dogs. We all got problems. Hey, gabe, I need to talk to you about something. It's really important. There's no way that you guys have any almond butter, right? Yeah, I don't know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job And the back of the printer started smoking And then the paper tray caught on fire. That's weird. I haven't heard of that happening. I would even settle for apricot preserves. What are we gonna do about this? I don't know. Call hq, see if they know anything. Yeah. That's what I'll do today. All right. Yeah. Let me know what they say. Wow. That dude is good. What do you mean? You didn't feel like he was hiding something? I don't know. Like he was Covering something up? Maybe. Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment That he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, And I was mad as hell at the time. But I said,  darryl, just wait.  he's a fool, there's gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient.  Hi, stranger. Oh, hi. You work fwr michael. I work with michae Right. Dwight schrute. Donna, hi. All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out If donna is a cheater is to seduce her, Bring her to orgasm, then call michael And tell him the sad news. That's interesting. Wow, it's a little early for ice cream, don't you think? It's never too early for ice cream, jim. But we didn't have any ice cream, So this is mayonnaise and black olives. Oh Oh, my god. It's comfort food, all right? God. You know, michael, this whole donna thing Is gonna be okay, you just- stop beating yourself up. I know. Well, I hope you're right. We'll see what dwight says. Why do we have to see what dwight says? Because I have him investigating her. I'm waiting for a text update. Michael, no-- no, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that. It's too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is gonna spiral out of amok. Michael. Okay, I'm-- I'm going to talk straight to you Because I think you need to hear it. Michael. God, this is so disgusting. Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you. I know. And you, you kind of torpedo Every romantic relationship you're in. That's not true. You're right, I ruin everything. And I've known some wonderful women. Holly, carol, jan. Helene. Helene? My mother. Oh. My mother, helene. Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life. You should stop this, And you should call dwight right now. All right. Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight At the same time; you go ahead. Thank you. It's all yours. Ah! Ah You okay? Yeah, I'm good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people That uses the whole body? Yeah, I think I know what you're talking about. Tractor pulling.

Well, I am just glad this is all over. Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, But she's coming over here and she's furious. What? No, she didn't say that. You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was,  what is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him.  And this was after I have no other recourse But to tell her and gym security That you had sent me there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You'll be billed monthly. I am not paying for that membership. Ohhh Mm Maybe you'd be more comfortable in your own office. No, I like the attention. is she here yet? Uh, no. Wait, yes. That's her? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right. Okay, I'll talk to you later. How could you think I would cheat on you? I didn't. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind. That's pathetic. Well, no. It's a lie. That's not what happened. I just like you. I can't believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want. When I tell you I like you, You need to trust me, not some freak. If you wanna dump me, I totally get it. I told you I like you. Well, you are boner-ific.
