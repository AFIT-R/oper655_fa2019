Yes,he bowled five frames with this pink,sparkly thing until a little girhad to ask for her ball back. But that girl must have had monstrous hands because the holes fit. No,you just have little dainty fingers. You could always model ladies' jewelry. Nobody asked,bob. Do you risk telling them how you feel? Do you say something that you can barely admit to yourself? Oh,god,what did you do?- So-- Wait,not that i approve of any of it,but-- I was stupid.I told him. Was he into you in,like,a gay way? Moron. If he was,there wouldn't be a story. He told me he wasn't gay. Really sad. I'm not done yet. Oh,my god. A week later,a friend of mine calls me up and he says,  I just saw him in a gay bar in kansas city.    Oh,no. Well,then it's a happy ending,because he was gay. You should call him. My worst breakup was actually two breakups. Two different men. I was in love with both of them,and when things went bad,they had a duel over me. Yeah,dwight and andy.We were here. No,this was years ago when i was living in ohio. John mark anjohn david. Angela,you had two sets of different men actually duel over you? I guess i have. All right. Who's next?Where's andy? He's on one of his honeymoons. What? He made non-Refundable deposits on his honeymoons, So he's just knockin' 'em off one at a time. I think today he's hot air ballooning,and later he's got a couples' massage. My worst breakup was with stacy. It was a sunday morning. We were reading the par. And i said, oh,my god. I think the eagles could clench the n.F.C. East.   And she said that we're done. You know what,ys? I don't think we need to do this. You're right.Okay,everyone,back to work. No,no,no,no.I mean,have this kind of party. I look around and i see all these beautiful people who are alone on valentine's, And i think that there are other single people out there,too. We just ne tfind 'em. There's a girl out there for all of us. Maybe even in this office park. There has to be a way to get all these lonely people together. A net?A giant net? No,not a giant net. A-- A-- A--  What do you have in mind? I was thinking maybe like a mixer. Oh,god.That's a terrible idea.- Old-Fashioned meat market. No. I don't think it is. Lonely people mixing with one another? Breeding? Creating an even lonelier generation? You're not allowing natural selection to do its work. Kind of like the guy who invented the seat belt. These people need love. And i am going to get it for them. Who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today? A great boss cares more about thhaceppiness of his employees than anything else. ******** I am going to be cupid,and i am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims, And they are going to get hit,and say, i'm in love! I was hit by cupid's sparrow.   Funny little bird,but he gets the job done.. No movement. Ah,still early. Eh,it's not that early. So how you holding up? I'm okay.Feel a little lopsided 'cause of all the blood they took out of my right side. No,no,i meant about being single today. Exactly. Oh,here we go. Hello. Hello. Dwight k.Schrute. Why don't you introduce me to your little friend? Dwight Babe alert! Hello,i'm michael scott.Welcome to our little shindig. Oh,hi,i'm lynn. Lynn,follow me.Come on in. Off we go. For you,we have one of our top people. Kevin malone. Kevin?Come out here.Show your beautiful self. Hello. So run with the ball. Run with it,kev. Where are you from? I'm from here. Y-- Okay. Well,he only gets better. Thank you,michael. Okay. I can untie any knot. I'm serious. Name a knot,any knot.Go ahead. Uh,i-- I believe you. You shouldn't believe everything you hear. In fact,there are many knots that i cannot untie. So where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today? Um,i work at a place that does catalogs for community colleges and small businesses. You must use a lot of paper. Oh,god.Tons of it. What's the rule about when people are in the bathroom? I think if you ordered hot food,you're allowed to eat. Damn. They've been in there for like ten minutes. Look at that. Bob ordered hot food. Yes. And i think they gave him too many fries. We should help him out. All right,the circle drive-In,they show old movies. It's really cool. That does sound cool. I used to go there with my fiancee. Before she left me. No,i-- I mean,before i left her. She left me. Stupid! I think i blew it. It all happened so fast. So fast. So erik,you mentioned before that you are in tool and dye repair. I am. Meredith recently had a total hysterectomy. So that's sort of a repair. L right.I'll let you guys talk. It's going very well.People are mixing. A lot of hope. 'Cause that's what you hate to see-- When hope gets crushed. Sorry. Thought i heard somebody coming in. Um,so it's not too late. And the kind of discoun we're talking about are not-- Hold on,hold on. Michael,why do you keep looking at the front door? No reason. Is somebody after you? Why do you always go to that? Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office? Hey,it just takes one. Nobody's after me. I just-- I met a woman when i was giving blood and i thought she might come by. You met a woman when you were giving blood?That is so romantic. It's not a big deal,really. I just-- You know,met mebody.We hardly talked. I picked up her glove,so i was hoping i could give it back to her. Oh,my god,that makes it even more romantic. This is like a modern-Dayenchanted. It's like a fairy tale. She could be your soul mate. Oh,not likely. Three billion women on the planet,most of them live in asia,so the numbers just don't add up. It's possible. She could be. Believe me,it's nothing. I hardly even talked to her. We just-- We were lying there next to each other. I think our blood bags touched. Here they come. What? -No,just kidding. Seriously,though,that's enough. Well,just cover it with the broccoli. Oh,great,i have to cover it with-- Do you think they dined and dashed? Well,they didn't dine. So yeah,maybe they just dashed. I thought we we having a nice time. We were. Yeah. Empty. Mine,too. Oh,boy. Okay. Oh,my go Is this the party? Nah. Okay,then. So where were we? Ah,bowling. Yep,yep.Yep. You didn't eat much there,jimbo. Oh,initially i did. Want some meat? Oh,sure. Little piece. No mushroom,though. Forgot. Yeah. Thank you. I'm sorry we did not have a chance to talk more. Yeah. I get very nervous talking to pretty girls. Seriously. Feel how sweaty my hand is. That's really sweaty. Are you on email? Oh,yeah. Cool. Okay,bye. Bye,kevin. Good valentine's. So basically the greater volume you decide to buy in,the greater discount we can give you. Okay. Okay? What's up?-Look,i'm-- I'm gonna go. Before you go,i'd st love to get a firm commitment on this. Um  you know,maybe sign? Look,we already have a paper supplier. Okay. Well,thanks for wasting my time tonight. Idiot. God! You don't deserve her. Thanks,michael. Hey,if anybody wants to go-- We can stay a little longer. Really? Yeah. Yeah.Sure,michael. No,this is great. We'll hanout.Absolutely. Yeah. Oh,thanks. Michael,it's time. You know what?You guys-- You guys can head out. I'm-- I'm gonna soldier on a little bit. Come on. We'll all go. Yeah.Yeah.Let's go.Yeah. Okay. Four months ago,i dated a woman named holly. And,um,this is actually the first time that i've even considered getting back into that arena again. You know what? Sometimes it's not about whether cinderella gets her slipper back, But it's about the fact that the prince even picked up the slipper at all. There's a lot of princesses out there. You know,they have all different sizes and shapes of feet. And hands. So i think i think my odds are pretty good. Pardon me.May i have a chocolate chip cookie? I gave blood earlier and i'm still feeling woozy. Of course. That's weird. You got a cotton ball and tape and we've been using band-Aids. I,uh-- Oh,i feel so woozy. I just-- It's band-Aids. Ah,damn.
