Hello, Son. If you're watching this, that means I'm already dead. Life is a How do you know it's gonna be a boy? How Would you stop interrupting, please? Yesterday, I was scraping some gunk off my wall sockets with a metal fork and I gave myself the nastiest shock. And when I came to, I had an epiphery. Life is precious. And if I die, I want my son to know the dealio. The dealio of life. Here are some things that I want to teach you that your mother won't be able to. To jump-start a car, first, pop the hood. Then you take these bad boys and clip them anywhere on the engine. Then, you take these and clip them wherever. Number eight, learn how to take off a woman's bra. What We will demonstrate on Pam.

As you know, we are six days away from Phyllis' wedding. So get your suits to the dry cleaners and get your hair did. And Karen, you might wanna invest in a dress or a skirt of some kind if you don't already have one. This may be Phyllis' only wedding ever. It's my job to insure that none of you look like ragamuffins. So I am instituting prima nocta. Prima nocta, I believe, from the movie Braveheart and confirmed on Wikipedia, is when the king got to deflower every new bride on her wedding night. So I'm sorry, I had a very different understanding as to what prima nocta meant. I'm trying to get everyone excited about Phyllis' wedding because I want her to get people excited about my wedding when the time comes, which won't be hard, because it's gonna be awesome. A lot better than hers, that's for sure. It'll probably be on a boat. What's up, spinsters? Nothing. You know, this is a luncheon shower. Girls only. No problem. The guys are having a little shindig of their own in the warehouse from 2:30 to 3:15. It is the only time that Bob was available. Sort of a guys' night out. A G.N.O. If you will. A gno. Actually, it's more of a guys' afternoon in. A G.A.I. A gay. Not Not It's not gay. It's just a It's a bridal shower for guys. A guy shower. An hour-long shower with guys. I guess Jim and I have had a little bit of a rough patch for the past couple weeks, but we had some really good talks and, actually now, I think that we're better than ever. Karen and I had a long talk last night and the night before that and every night for the last five nights. Something's up with Jim and Karen. Not that I've been eavesdropping. It's not really any of my business. But I've gotten pretty good at reading the back of Jim's neck. Halpert! Tall, queer, handsome as ever.  Hey, everybody, it's me, Jim.   Hello, hello. Todd Packer. Karen Filippelli, Jim's girlfriend. Shut up! Yep. Shut it! That's rude. Either this chick is a dude or Halpert got scared straight. Yes! Yes! There What happened? What? Oh, God Quick! Somebody help! Help the man! No! No! No! I can't believe you're not gonna be there. It's gonna be good. It's gonna be a great bachelor party, man. I have a full day of sales calls. You should get out of them. Oh, God. It's the only time he can do it. It's gonna be great. We're going to be doing some darts, we're gonna be grilling up some steaks. Got some pie, going to be very delicious. And what kind of stripper did you get? I did not order a stripper. What do you mean you didn't order a stripper? No You ever even been to a bachelor party? Not personally, no. Mike, okay. A stripper is Bachelor Party 101. I I If you don't get a stripper, your party's gonna suck. I can't get a stripper here. Sexual harassment. Get one for the girls, too. That evens it out. Like, you know, separate but equal. So that's what that means. Okay, everybody, a slight change of plans. We are still going to be having two parties, but each is going to get a little extra dose of naughty. All right! Okay. What? Okay, co-ed naked strippers in this office, for realsies. Under no circumstance should a man strip off his clothes in this office. Shut up, Angela! Hey. Hey! Everything okay? Oh, yeah. Why? Well, you seem a little tired.
