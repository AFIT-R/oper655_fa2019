Everybody, can I please  have your attention?   Ryan and I have a huge announcement.   Oh my gosh.  Wow.   Over the weekend,  Ryan Bailey Howard and I got divorced.   Sweet.  Free ring.   Divorced?   Just so you know, it's totally amicable.  We're fine.   We don't need people here  to take sides.   The last thing that we want  is any kind of drama.   Wait, I  Can you back up?   What's the story?   We were having a beautiful  weekend in the Poconos.   We were making love constantly.   We saw the sun rise,  and Ryan was crying a lot.   That's not a relevant detail.  And in the morning,   we walked by a chapel  and we stopped suddenly,   and Ryan said    I don't think I should  be married to you anymore.    Wait, wha   Sorry, when did you get married?   Um, like a week ago.   We got really wasted,  and it just felt right.   And you didn't invite any of us?   We are getting divorced, Andy!   This is such a raw time.   God, baby, you know,  with people's reactions to this,   I wonder if we made a mistake.   No, with the messed-up laws  in this country,   I don't want to be married  until everyone can be married.   You know what, Ryan?   I talked to the other gay guys,   and we're okay with it.   We all agreed it's fine  for you to get married.   No. No, Oscar.   Not not until  everyone can.   Ryan, I changed my mind.   Okay, fine.  You know what?   This actually  isn't amicable at all,   and we actually do need people  to take sides.   Who's on my side?   And who is on my side?    All right, bye.   Bye.  Let's go.   Just a minute!   How long do we have to wait?  For what?   You broke up with A.J. weeks ago.   Don't you have  a sales call to go on?   I don't understand.  I really don't, I mean   We know we're gonna  start dating Why not now?   We don't know that.  Sure we do.   Why is it such a certainty   that we're supposed  to be together?   Why does the sun  rise in the morning?   Why do magnets stick together?   Because everybody says so.  Everybody.   Michael, I can't keep getting  into a situation   where I date  whoever I'm working with.   Well you can  understand that.   Yeah, I understand.   I just don't agree.   Well, you don't have to agree.   Yes, I do.   No, you don't.   Yes, I do.   No, you can have  your own opinion   I have my own opinion,  and my opinion   is to disagree with you.   He's gonna be a lot of fun   to drive around in a car with.   Ah, you'll get through it, hon.   Just make a game out of it.   A funny Jim game.   That's it?  That's all I get?   Even after all the hard work  I put into   celebrating your talent today.   All right, what'd you do?   Well, those things  that you consider doodles   I consider art.   Where'd you put it?   Where'd I put what?  Let's go.   Oh, sorry.  I gotta go.   Say it. Where?  Okay, fine.   Three hints: One,  when you're getting colder,   you're really getting warmer.   The fridge.  Two!   You have a better chance  if you think Bob Vance.   The fridge, got it.   And the final clue  Let's go!   You know what?  Just think about it.   You'll be fine.  Bye.   Holly is ruining Michael's life.   He thinks she's so special.   And she's so not.   Her personality is like a three,   her sense of humor is a two,   her ears are like a seven  and a four.   Add it all up,  and what do you get?    And he treats her  like she's a perfect 40.   It's nuts.   Cheer up.  We made a sale.   Just drive faster.  I wanna get back.   Well, I'm going the speed limit.   Okay, fine.   My feelings don't matter to you.   What matters to you  is your precious speed limit.   Someone's in a bad mood.   No, I'm not.   I'm not in a bad mood.   I'm not, Jim.  Hello?   Okay, fine, ignore me.   Have it your way.   Let's just talk about you.   As always.   Sex different  after the baby, Jim?   All right, let me  turn on some music.   I need to pee!  No, you don't.   Yeah, I do.  My word against yours.   All right, well,  we'll be there in ten minutes.   What part of  I need to pee   do you not understand?   I'm upset, my bladder is full,   there is no telling  what I might do, right now,   all over the inside of your  precious little car.   All right, well,  if I see a gas station,   I'll pull over.  Well, I hope I make it.   Hello?   Hi, Jim, it's Helene.   Hey, Helene.  Is everything okay?   Everything's fine.  Baby's fine.   She has a tiny fever.  I'm taking her for a checkup.   Nothing to worry about, uh   Okay.   A tiny thing.  I locked her in the car.   What?  She's smiling. She's happy.   Oh, my God.  Jim, I Jim   Oh, my God.  I don't have a spare key.   Just just stay there.   I'll be there in one second.   Michael!   Michael!   Excuse me, sir, there's a   There's a guy in the bathroom.   He's coming out,  but I have to go,   'cause it's an emergency.   Will you just tell him  to call the office?   Just call  Call the office.   Thank you! Please?   Hello?   This is Pam.  Hey, it's me.   So, uh, don't worry.  Everything's okay.   What's wrong?  Nothing, absolutely nothing.   But you're not holding a cup of  coffee or anything, are you?   Jim, what?  UhOkay.   So Cece had a little bit  of a fever.   And your mom also  locked her in the car.   Oh, God. What?  No, no, no, it's okay.   So Cece's with daddy now,   and she is laughing  and she's happy,   and we're on our way  to see Dr. Barbara.   Okay, so she's okay?   Yes, and your mom got  a very well-deserved day off.   So here's the thing, though.   I left Michael at the gas station   on Bennett.   Understood.   And his wallet and phone are  on the seat next to him.   Got it.   I will put out an A.P.B.   otherwise known as  an  Ask Pam Beasley.    Did the phone cut out?   Nope.   All right, just call me  after the doctor.   Okay.  All right, bye.   Bye.   I know, I know.   You have a phone policy.  I understand.   But this is an emergency,   because my friend isn't here,   and I'm worried  that he has been abducted.   No.  And and   No, he ditched you, man.  I saw him drive away.   There's no way he ditched me.   There's no way that happened.   He's my Okay.   May I please just  use your phone? Please.   Just make it quick.   Thank you. Okay.   I will make it quick.  I will make it very quick.   And you don't have my numbers  on speed dial.   Aah, okay, what is it?   You don't know.   Oh, co come  You don't.   You know what?   I could dial 411,  get Jim's number   He left you here  on purpose, all right?   I saw it.   He just drove away.   Actually, this is good.   I am going  to take this opportunity   to go walkabout.   Good, good.   No, get away.   No. That's enough.   Okay.   Okay.   It's the gas station  on Bennett Street?   Yeah.   You know what?   Why don't you stay and I'll go?   Oh, no, no, no, I'll be fine.   It's kind of a sketchy  neighborhood, though.   I better come along.   Problem solved, everyone.   Space Orphan  and Princess Nincompoop   are off to rescue Michael.   Unbelievable.  I'm going.   You drive.  I got a car full of fox meat.   Cute.   Very funny, everyone.   Who wrote captions  under my doodle?   I'm not even kidding.  They're pretty good.   Which one in particular?  Yeah, which one?   Well, the first one  has a surprise factor.    I'm a suck-suck-suckety Sabre.    Boo-yah!   No. No, no.   No, no, no.   But, uh, I suppose the second one   is the better written line.   You suppose?  What's it say?    I'm supposed  to be wearing red gloves,   but my color cartridge portal  got jammed again.    Okay, no, no, no, no, no.   Gloves.   Keep it real.   You guys, if I knew you  wanted to do a caption contest,   I would have drawn  something more challenging.   And I will take you all down.  You?   I been reading  the comics to my daughter   since she was three years old.   Not once have I used the real  captions to Family Circus.   That crazy family is hilarious  to her for one reason   Me.   Oh, it is on   like Genghis Khan  wearing Sean John in Bhutan.   Yes. You guys,  I have the perfect idea.   Okay, it'll just  take me ten minutes.   Whoo-hoo!  All right.   I want to do it.   Male, Caucasian, 40s, black hair,   facial type marsupial.   He answers to Michael,  Michael G. Scott,   Michael J. Fox, Mr. Fox,  the Incredible Mr. Fox.   Yeah, he just left.  Which way did he go?   Hey, hey, hey, hey,  let me answer this.   Stupid question.  He went back to the office,   obviously, which is that way.   Oh, really?   You don't think  he walked by that bakery   just for the smell of it?   She's right.  He went that way.   All right.   Don't get a swelled head.  You're no tracker.   Let's ride.   Hey, you guys.  Listen to me.   Don't get hung up  on just one girl,   because there are a lot  of other girls over there.   Look over there.  See?   They look cute.   Hello.   You guys are so beautiful.   You're so colorful.   I wish I could understand you.   That's a metaphor, I guess.   You are disgusting.   You'll never find love.   Lecch.   Do you think she needs more time,   or it's just never gonna happen?   I'm being serious.  Seriously.   Dunder Mifflin.  This is Pam.   Has Michael checked in?   Oh, hey, Dwight.  I asked you a question.   No, he hasn't.  Okay, bye.   No, wait, um, hey,  while you're out,   could you pick up some paper  towels and chocolate syrup?   We have ice cream,  so I thought we could   Pam, this isn't a shopping trip.   This is a manhunt-slash-rescue  mission.   Okay, I just   When you're done,  or any time it's convenient,   I just thought  since you're out   Pam, I'm obviously  gonna get that stuff for you,   so just shut up.  God.   Okay, well, it wasn't ob   No word from Michael.   Tada.   Okay, it's two giant dogs  with two giant palm trees   on a regular-sized island.   Oh, I got one.  Yeah?   Yes.  Okay, I'm sorry,   but I'm gonna have  to shut this down.   Boo.  Why?   Unless we can all agree  to some ground rules.   It's either that  or I can fax this to Jo   and let her decide  how to proceed.   Gabe, tell us your stupid rules   so we can start the game.   Number one,  and this should be obvious,   no captions that insult  the company we work for.   Irony is such a critical   Number two,  no pop culture references.   Seriously?  Wow.   I think we can all agree   they tend to alienate those  who don't get the reference,   making them feel like the other.   Wrap it up, Gabe.   Okay, final thing,  and this is a fun one,   instead of writing the caption  directly under the picture,   let's all try using sticky quips.   All right?  New from Dunder Mifflin-Sabre.   Sticky quips are fun,  they're safe, they're handy.   I like to use sticky quips  as regular post-it notes   when I'm in a fun mood.   Not every day.   Go get 'em.  Start quipping.   Pam, I think  I'm gonna send you an I.M.   Oh, okay.   Send me one too.   Yeah, yeah, yeah, put me on that.   C.C.  Ditto.   Hello.   I would like a hot dog, please.   Now, I don't have any money,   so here is what  I would like to do.   I leave you here with my watch,   and I come back later  and I pay for the hotdog.   I'm not a pawn shop.   Well, I understand that,  but this is a $45 watch.   Wow.   With that, I could buy   Half the menu.   I can't just go  giving away hotdogs.   All right.   What do you do with the hotdogs  that you don't sell?   Throw 'em away.   Well, okay, instead of  throwing them all away later,   why don't you just throw  one away now into my mouth.   No.   Okay.  You've just lost my business.   Hey.   Hey, you were in there forever.   There's too many brands.  Where's Holly?   She wandered off like an idiot.   Hey.  Hey.   What are you doing?   Oh, just changing  my cell phone plan.   Okay. Okay.  Here you go.   I'll take my free  stress ball too now.   Sure thing.  Here you go, miss   Okay, Fanny Smellmore.   Real original.  What?   You know what? Say hi  to Orville Tootenbacher for me.   Tootenbacher.   Orville Tootenbacher,   that's Michael's  millionaire character that   Farts popcorn.   Of course. He was here.   She's the key. Amazing.   Holly.   Hey, where would you  like to go next?   Holly?   Are their egg rolls  really that big?   Oh, boy.  That was yummy.   Thank you so much.   You know what? I think  I left my wallet in my car.   Do you mind  if I run out and get it?   No problem.  Okay.   I'll be right back.   Okay, you know what?   I'm sorry. I'm sorry.   I don't have my wallet.  And I was   I was gonna try to dine and dash,   and that was stupid,   and I realize I can't do that  to you fine people.   So you can't pay for your food?   Well, I can, but I will have  to come back later tonight   and pay you.   But the point is  I did the right thing.   You did not.   You have no money,   but you dined,  and you dined so much.   Well, the number three  is not such a giant feast.   Mr. Chu!   Okay, all right.  You know what?   You're trying  to steal food from us?   I am not.   I just have had a bad day,   and I  Okay.   I'll be back later  with the money.   I'm just gonna leave right now.   You can't.  We'll stop you.   Well, I think  I can get through the door.   Excuse me.  Do you speak English?   We are looking for a man,   Michael, this tall,  black hair, Caucasian.   It's Michael!   He just left.   You knew!  What?   No. Dwight asked  if I wanted an egg roll.   What What are you  implying?   Uncanny.  Put a pin in that.   Which way did he go?   That guy!  When he leave here,   which way did he go?  We looking for him.   This way, this way, this way?  I don't know.   Do you know?   I think he was heading downtown.   He's heading downtown.   So what, no one's even gonna try?   Guess not.  Oh, come on.   My rules could not possibly  have been that oppressive.   You crushed our spirits, Gabe.   Congrats.  You're a big man, huh?   Takes a lot to destroy  the creativity   of a whole group of people.   Hey   Click the  x .   I'm clicking!  In the box.   I am clicking.   Woman, you've had  a computer for years!   Phyllis!  Too late!   Oh. Ha.  An I.M. chat.   Very clever.   I'll just print that out.   Come on, guys.  Grow up.   I don't want to be  your babysitter.   Ooh.    Darn it, Bob,  I told you not to buy   a Sabre brand lifeboat.    Nice!  No, not nice.   Terrible.   Doesn't even include  the fact that they're dogs.   Do the next one.   Wake up, Fred.    The power cord  on your Sabre printer    shocked you into a coma,   and you're dreaming you're a dog  on a desert island.    Dreaming he's a dog on an island.   Uh, excuse me, excuse me.   How does the speaker know what  the guy in the coma is dreaming?   Well, if you think  it's so easy, Gabe,   why don't you try it?  Um   You don't have to sniff  my rear end anymore, Bob.   I'm the only one here.  Ha.   That's tasteless, Gabe.   Tasteless?  Tasteless.   More tasteless than this?    Is that a palm tree,    or did Gabe get skinner?   Either way, let's pee on it.   Ladies and gentlemen,  I think we have a winner.   Yes.  Yes. Well done!   Whose is it?  Who wrote that?   Yeah.  Who wrote it?   Please. It was easy  once I decided   I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe.   Where did he go, Holly?   I have no idea.   Do you see a little clown  that you wanna follow, huh?   Is there a little bird  that's chirping to you,    this way, this way.    I don't know.   Okay. Close your eyes.   We need you to think.   What is Michael seeing right now?   Can you tell him  that we miss him?   Michael, we're coming for you!   Will you stop?   There have been  a few coincidences   That's all!   All right, then.   Someone propose a plan.  Okay.   We fan out  Not you, Erin.   Stop looking at me like that.   Okay, look, let's just  go up somewhere high   and see if we could spot him  on the street below.   That is the stupidest idea  I've ever heard. No.   Tap into your common mind and  tell us what he would do next.   Look, I'm not playing.  I'm gonna go look for him.   Good. We don't need her.  Right.   I can do this on my own.  I can think like Michael.   All right   I'm deep below the ocean's  surface in a submarine.   A torpedo's coming right at me.   No. Damn it, that's just  my own imagination.   Maybe he's bowling.   Michael?   Hi.   How did you know I was up here?   What are you doing up here?   I got turned around.   I thought I could see  Dunder Mifflin.   Dunder Mifflin?   Yeah.   Wow!   I just miss you so much.   I missed you too.   Really?   Yeah.   Can I kiss you?   Yeah.  Okay.    Maybe that's not the best one.  Keep reading.   Yeah, it was.  Maybe it wasn't.   Oh, thank God, I had a horrible nightmare  that I was stuck in America with Gabe.   No, that's not the one I was thinking of.  Keep going.   I know what it smells like   but I didn't roll in anything,   It's from listening  to all of Gabe's bullshit.   Isn't this the perfect  romantic getaway, Erin?   Sitting on a desert island  in dog costumes?   I'm Gabe and I'm a weirdo.   Gabe's mom   Mm, Gabe's mom?   Wait, tall woman?  Looks like Gabe?   Yeah, I banged her.   Yeah, there you go.
