I wasn't sure about your branch of the famil after i heard about your parents divorce. But you and jim are just perfect. God bless you. Oh,thank you. But nobody's perfect.

And so kind.  ,and that's when i'll do the face like-- like, what?   right. And then wll just give 'em a little punch to the back. A noogie. You ow what? Never to married Never. For a noogie. They have hilarious material,and they are going to totally deliver it wrong. I would kill with the brother stuff. It should be me up there. Should be me and pete. Not pete and tom. Pam,you've got the greatestmile, and your body is really fine. Smoking. Hoping it'll make r wives kick it up a notch. A little mo' cardio. That's not appropriate. Okay,a little more Hello. Hi,everybody. I promise i wasn't nna make a toast,d i'm not going to. Just going to do a little freestanding comedy, and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to pam and jim,then so be it. Hey,what is the deal with the smart car? How smart is that? Those things are tiny. Can you even drive them in traffic?  oh,i'm so smart.  e equals mc Squared. I--i drive a smart car.   that's not smart in my book. The real smart car is kitt. From knight rider. Ight rider. That's a car that can talk. N a art car ta? Nope. That's not smart. And also chitty chitty bang bang. Very smart. And You-- everybody can laugh. It doesn't have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh. Nope. Yeah,go ahead. All right. Hey,everyone. Thanks for coming. Douche. Ah,thanks,pete. That was really nice. I just wt to say how happy we are that allf you are hereonight, and i want to especially thank those of you who have traveled frofar away to be here with us tonight, especially the florida cousins,who obviously can't ke a hint. Four years ago,i was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And i do the hardest thing that i've ever had to do which was just to wait. Uh,don't get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam,i can now admit in front of friends and family that i do know how to make a photocopy. Didn't need yo help that many times. And,uh,do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive stick? Like,a year. Ve been driving stick since high school,so Very nice. For a really long time,that's all i had. I just had little moments with a girl o saw me as a friend. And a lot of peopl told me i was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who i worked with, but i think even then i knew that I was waiting r my we. So I would like to propose a toast. So if you'd all raise your glasses-- not pam, for obvious reons,but everyone else,if y would raise your glasses What's obvious? Why can't pam drink? Pam can't drink? Who--i didn't-- i shouldn't have said that. I don't know why i did. She can do whatever she wants. Though she shouldn't. She shouldn't,becae she's an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That's not true. I--no. What we nted-- the real reason is that,um That--that pam's pregnant. Ok. Okay,okay. Hey. What i thi jim is trying to say is that Th had an accident,and you know what? These two people,they're living together. They are having lots of consensual sex. They wliving together? Yes. Yes,they were living tog-- yes. And you know what? You can't expect them be careful every time, because,frankly,it's just a different sensation. Michael. When you come-- well,am i wrong? They say it's not different,but it's a different sensation Oh,my god. Don't. Please. When you use something to block I ink everybody knows what i am talking about. It's not necessarily different for the woman, but it is different-- michael. Okay. Okay,okay,okay. Michael. Stop. All rit. My point is,i said what i nted to say, and,meemaw,i hope you heard every word. All right. Jim. To waiting. To waiting. Okay. i should have known. The hotel's television set had a movie on called bruno last night. The remote control had so darn many buttons on it, i couldn't turn it off. So i had to just sit there while it happened to me. I wondered, how could they pick such a hotel?   mm. Now i know. Meemaw. Think it was a little uch and go at first, but we saved it,i believe. I can't believe it was me. I know. I can't believe it was you,either. I actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me. Is there something about being a manager that mak you say stupid things? I have not found that to be the case. Hey,smooth guys. I'm so sorry. Can you believe it? He screwed up,not me. Meemaw's not coming to the wedding. She's leavin tomorrow morning. Oh,my god. Are you serious? There's gonna be a free room? Hi,meemaw. It's michael. Oh,you're that foul man that kept talking about intercourse. Yes. Yep,one and the same. May i? I'm actually great with old women. In fact,for the longest time,my best frie was my grandmother. And en she met harriet,and now she thinks she's better than everybody. I want to go to bed,but i can't. I can't turn that television off. Oh. Okay,well Hook you up there. Oh,thank you. You're welcome. It was that horrible charlie rose. Isn't he terrible? May i? Here's the thing. Um Meemaw,i think yo just need to chill out out this whole pam getting pregnant thing. It's not 1890 anymore. It's modern day. Anwomen have sex before marriage. And i think we need to celebrate that. And i know in your day she would be considered a whore, ii but now women go out and they have sex and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them. And we need to encourage that. That's part of life. People are like cats and dogs these days. Exactly. Thissed to be such a great country. I know. I don't know what happened it. They're gonna name the baby after y,you know? They're gonna call it meaw. You mean sylvia. Yes. And if it's a boy,they will call it sylvio. Par-tay. Room 639. yes. Chicks are gonna be off the hook. Guys too,oscar. Like calvin klein models. That sounds epic. Can we bring anything? Nothing. Except for $40 for beer and any hot chicks you know. 'Cause that would help me deliver on some prises i made. Whoo! No one from the office has been to a real beard throw-down. If i was a girl,i would seriously reconsider coming to this party. But don't tell them that i said that,'cause i want them there. And where do you thi you're gng? I was just gonna go down to the hotel bar for a little bit. Well,why don't i just save y some time and kick you in the stomach instead? I just wanted to get out of my room for a lite while. Okay. I'll go with you. Come on. Never mind. Are you sure? Could fun. Yup. No. What are you wearing? What? It's a casual,social outfit. Looks like you're going to a fish fry,dwight. No,th're howling at the moon. It's suggestive to women. Because of howling during sex. Okay. Th's not appropriate,ight. Uncool. Uncool,dwight. Okay. Okay,come on. Let's go. Good. It's good. It's not a good idea. There's no such thing as a good hairpiece. Yeah,but that's easy enough for you to say,oscar. You have that thick,beautiful,chicano hair. So nice. I'm just worried about the farm,you know? Mose hates to geld the horses by himself. Dwight,shut up about the farm. It's not relatable. Nobody owns a farm. Wait,you're worried about your horses? That's cool. How many horses do you have? Nine and three quarters. I invented a device called burger on the go. It allows you to obtain six regular-sized hamburgers or without killing the animal. George foreman is still considering it.
