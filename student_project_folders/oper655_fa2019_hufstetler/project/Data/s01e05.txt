Hey. You ready? All right. Secret sign. Hey, Ryan. Very good. Excellent. Excellent. Michael. Today at lunchtime we're going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball. My idea. I noticed they'd put up a couple of hoops and I play basketball every weekend so I thought,  This might be kinda fun.   And I started messing around and Im sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans, so You know, it's really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together. Pam, Pam, thank you, ma'am. Messages, please. Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team. No. That's not me being mean. That is based on your past behavior. Please. When I let him come to my pick-up game I apologized for that. I vouched for you. I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight. All right, here's what I'm gonna do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar. I can handle that. Good. Excellent. It'll be fun. Because Corporate wants somebody to be here on Saturday and so we have to have some people come in on the weekend, and I know everybody's gonna complain and bitch and I don't wanna deal with that. It's why you have an assistant manager. Yes, it is. Assistant to the regional manager. Same thing. No, it's not. It's lower, so It's close. So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that should be Jim. God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I've ever seen go to someone's head. Phyllis, can you believe this? Keep me out of it. My fiancé has plans for us this Saturday so I really hope Dwight doesn't make me work. Maybe I should sleep with him? I'm kidding. Kidding. Totally kidding. All right! Managing by walking around! This is our warehouse. Or, as I like to call it, the whorehouse. Don't you do that. I've earned the right. Fine, don't worry about that. And here we have  Mister Roger's Neighborhood . Come on over here. Hey, this is Ryan. He's temping upstairs. What's up? This is the foreman, Mister Rogers. Not my real name. No, Darryl is Mister Rogers. Darryl Rogers? Darryl Philbin. Then Regis, then Rege, then Roger, then Mister Rogers. And that is Lonny. And this is Roy. Roy dates Pam. The best-looking one upstairs. Yeah. You still getting it regular, man, huh? I mean, I can tell her it's part of the job. Rapport. No, I know that the warranty's expired but isn't it supposed to last longer than two years if it isn't defective? OK, fine, three years. Pam gets a little down. Her toaster oven broke. Which she got at her engagement shower. For a wedding that still has yet to be set. And that was three years ago. So, one o'clock sharp and we've got a game on. We're loading at one. I see, you're chickening out on me. No, we got a truck going out at 1:15. That's the busy time. Well, I'm glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I'm down here it doesn't seem too busy to me. Oh. Oh. You can dish it out but you can't take it. OK, fine, have it your way. All right, fine, you know what? One o'clock. All right, see you at one. Are we ready for the game? Yeah. I know. Grumble, grumble, but you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that dwarf from Lord Of The Rings. Gimli. Nerd. That is why you're not on the team. Just trying to be helpful.  I'll help. Elwyn Dragonslayer  Ten points, power sword.   That's him. So let's put together a starting line-up, shall we? Stanley, of course. I'm sorry? What do you play, center? Why  of course ? What's that supposed to mean? I don't know. I don't remember saying that. I heard it. Well, people hear a lot of things, man. Um other starters Me, of course. I heard it that time. I'd like to play if it's just for fun. I played basketball in school. Um Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart. I'm getting paid to skip lunch? Yes. OK. Yes. This is business. The business of team building and morale boosting. Uh who else? I can help out if you need me. I will use your talents come baseball season. Or if we box. I have a hoop in my driveway. No. I have a sports bra. No, ridiculous. Michael, look. Close. All right. Uh Me, Stan the man, Jim, Ryan and Dwight. Yes! Sorry, Phyllis. Can I be captain? No, I am. Can I be team manager? You're assistant to the manager. Assistant team manager? No. OK, we'll see who's working this weekend then. Jim, take over the vacation schedule. Oh, my God. Threat neutralized. Off the backboard! Please don't throw garbage at me. Oh, Pam, with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some pigtails, a little haltertop, tie that up. And something a little, just, youthful, for a change. Just this once. I don't think so, Michael. Besides, I can't cheer against my fiancé. I'll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and I bet you would. Just try not to be too gay on the court. And by gay I mean you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way. I think that goes without saying. Maybe Angela would cheerlead. Yeah, right. I'll do it. Yuk. That's worse than you playing. Cos we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt. That's where we need you. Blessed be those who sit and wait. You made it. Suit up, you're on the team! All right, cool! Very good. Oh-oh. Oh-oh. A spy from the warehouse. Trying to figure out our plays? Just getting a tea bag. He's running. He's running but he can't hide because one o'clock, you better bring your A game. Because me and my posse guys are gonna be in your face. Right in your face! Why don't we make it more interesting? Loser buys dinner at Farley's. Wo-ho. I like the way you think. I'm gonna take that one step further. Loser works on Saturday. No, that's not as much fun. You know what? What? You're on. OK. Cool. You're on. Don't screw this up. Classic beginner's mistake eating before a game. Has anyone seen the first-aid kit? How many times have I told you? I'm the safety officer, not you. Basketball? It was my thing in high school. And, yeah, I'm looking forward to playing. I think I'm gonna impress a few people in here. You coming down? Yeah, I'm just forwarding the phones. Gonna wish me luck? Yeah, you're gonna need it. Is that trash talk from Pam? I'm just saying, Roy is very competitive and he wants to take the Wave Runner to the lake this Saturday so Well, I'm going to the outlet mall on Saturday, so if you wanna save big on brand names, and Roy has to work, which he will, because I'm also competitive, you should feel free to come along. Um I think I'm gonna be up at the lake. I think I'll see you at the mall. Yeah. Hey. There he is. Secret weapon! All right, guys, come on, let's bring it in! Here we go! OK, listen, this is just going to be a friendly game, right? We are all on the same team here. The Dunder Mifflin team. Of course, if you beat us you're fired. That's a joke. OK, let's do it! Have a good game. Yeah, you too. Should be fun. All right, everybody stretch out a little bit. Stretch it. Ryan, you wanna stretch? I stretched before I came. OK, Ryan, you have Darryl. I have Roy. Really? I thought I'd take Roy. Roy is their best player, not Lonny. So, Dwight, you have the East German gal. Um OK. All right, you guys! OK, we'll be skins Come on, Dwight. What? Shirts on or off? On. Just put it on. You sure? Yes. Pam? You have your foot in both camps, why don't you do the jump ball, OK? Don't listen to him. Tip it my way or you're sleeping in the car. Stanley! What?

I don't know. I might just be a basketball machine. What's Dunder Mifflin? I've never heard of it. Filing? Paperwork? Who cares? Possible downsizing? Um Well, that's probably gonna happen, actually.
