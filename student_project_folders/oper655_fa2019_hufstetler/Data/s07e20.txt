Did that did that just happen? We should write a movie or something. I'm serious. Michael is leaving, and apparently they already hired a new manager. And we're meeting him today. That's a lot to process, paperwork-wise. No, it's not Ashton Kutcher. It's Kevin Malone. Equally handsome, equally smart. Okay, everyone, as you know, one of my favorite things is fanfare for its own sake. So without further ado, let's all start clapping. Presenting D'Angelo Vickers! Hi! Hello. Come on out! Oh. Hello. Hey. How are you, sir? I'm well, sir. How are you? Uh, can I just say, I am so excited to be working here. A little bit about myself I love the American southwest, for starters. You may call them Arizona, new Mexico, Nevada, Utah. I call them heaven. I have a peanut allergy. Something I live with. It's a part of me. I've learned to cope with it. What else I'm just as comfortable at a ball game as I am at the opera. I was a did I want to be made manager? Sure. A great opportunity squandered? Absolutely. A crushing blow? Yes. Will I get over it? Mmm No. But life goes on. Not for me. I'll get that, guys. No, I'll help you. Here. You know, it's just you know? Oh, hi. Hello. Hi. Have we met before? No, not officially. I saw you coming out of the bathroom earlier. Well, I guess I'm gonna go back to my cave. Okay. It was really great meeting you. And that Is what they call a  meet cute.  So we talked for, like, 20 minutes. No clue it's D'Angelo the whole time. That's kind of embarrassing. No, no. Yeah, that story makes you sound stupid. I happen to like the hilarious hijinks that I get myself into. There he is there D'Angelo, I was just telling them about last night when we met. Oh. Remember that? That was crazy. That was great.  Uh, let's see. Where's my replacement?   Where's the guy I'm replacing?  I don't know. Why don't I look to my left? I know. You're sitting right there. I know. Well, that's that's what I was just saying. That's the that exact situation is why I always carry around a couple of these. Just in case, 'cause, you know, sometimes you need to I.D. Yourself. Office funny guy. Always glad to have an office funny guy around. I wasn't even trying to make a joke. But I guess I've always been sort of quirky. Offbeat. A little twisted. This is Jim and Pam, aka  Jap.  What started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes. Well, it was it wasn't an affair. Yes, it was. But, no but we are a family. We made that. Cecilia. Aw. Congratulations. Thank you. I have four kids of my own. Really? Yeah. Oh, my gosh. Well, we just have the one, but she poops for four. Uh-oh, someone started off on a good foot with the new boss. Yeah, they don't ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies, so. Psst. Thanks for meeting me. Are you kidding? I would come anywhere to see a turtle. Yeah. Where'd you find him? There's no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here. You know me very well, Dwight. That's because I'm your right-hand man, Michael. But I can't do it. I can't do it again. I can't be a right-hand man to a whole new guy. Now I'm gonna have to go online and look at turtles, or else I'm gonna be off the whole day. I want to be manager. I just don't understand why I wasn't even interviewed for the job. You know, what's wrong? I'm totally qualified. You were pushing for me. That apple looks delish. I do a lot of portion control. Try to keep my daily caloric intake under 1,200. D'Angelo, you're going to starve to death. So you decided to have an orgy and not invite me? Come on! I call middle. It's cool that you like the southwest. It's one of my favorite regions.  It's one of my favorite regions.  Did I just sound totally lame? No. I sounded good. I love the desert. It's one of my favorite ecosystems. Here's the great thing about the southwest. There is so much more than desert. Along the north rim of the grand canyon is a forest as lush as you've ever seen. Burned. It's lush, dummy. Hey, uh, D'Angelo. What do you think about bald people? I hate them. D'Angelo, I forget, did you mention you liked politics? I did not. Because I was thinking, you should meet my boyfriend. He's a state senator. I really think the two of you would hit it off. He's a great person to know. Sounds very interesting. Thank you. Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. Okay, let me transfer you. Why do you use your name when you answer the phone? Oh, that's how Pam does it. I just copy her. She's she's sort of a living legend. Try it without using your name. Dunder Mifflin, this is. Oh, yeah. I like it. Dunder Mifflin, how may I assist you? Oh, assist. I sort of like the old way. I just prefer it without the name. I thought Okay, no, no, no. I gotta start doing some managing at some point, right? I know, I know. I'm sorry. But if it's not a big deal, we should just do the old way. And it really isn't. Okay. That good? Yeah, okay, good. Well, I'd like to change it, actually. Well, you know, whatever. Yeah. Whatever you think would work. What do you think? I think a change would be nice. You could do the old way, or the, you know, whichever one you want to do. Change it. I'm so sorry. Sorry. Hey, funny guy. I'm having a little mid-day lull here. Make me laugh. Huh? What do you got? Uh I can't even look at you. Here we go. Okay. Okay, what do, um, African-Americans call the What? Um. D'Angelo. Yeah? Did you order a barber? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Come on back here. Put a pin on that. I can't I can't wait to hear the punch line. Finish the joke, Andy. What do African-Americans call? I don't know. Help me. That is so bad-ass. Just so hardcore. Yeah, very cool. Real power move. Yeah. Saw a hawk today. Just sitting right there on the overpass, looking at me. Shave me. Well, this is going to be funny, because it looks like we're gonna be shaving buddies. Okay, all right. I love it. Ha, ha, ha, ha! I love it. Michael, this is Reggie. Hello. He's the number-one yelp-reviewed shaver in Scranton. It's not even close. And this is Erin, and she's going to shave my face. Here we go. All right. This is how we do it. Mmm. Feels nice, doesn't it? It really does. This is luxury. Here we go. Okay. Oh, that is nice. You wanted to talk to us, D'Angelo? Oh, yes, yes. Please cozy up there. I just thought we could have some rap sessions with smaller groups. You know, we don't really do rap sessions. We kind of do God! We sort of do more of like pow-wows or whatevs. Okay, well, pow-wows then, fine. That's Hey, D'Angelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece. It is so adorable. All right, wait, but a little bit of back-story. She loves dogs. She calls them  da-das.  Da-das. And what happens is you know what? Enough about your baby, okay? Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, we were just I think she was just trying to no, no, no. I know what you're doing. Just quit it. I want to hear from the rank and file. How can I be the best manager for you all? You know, what can I do better? Okay, you know what, everybody? There's you have to be honest here. You you can't say that everything is perfect, right? So, you know, come up with something. Well, D'Angelo, I'd say communication could be improved. People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them  urgent.  Okay, you know what, I mark it urgent  a,  urgent  b,  urgent  c,  urgent  d.  Urgent  a  is the most important. Urgent  d  you don't even really have to worry about. Okay, um, Michael, can you stop talking now? I have to do your lips. Don't shave my lips. What's up? I don't mean to go off on a rant here, but I wrote the perfect joke. Topical, edgy. Funny. I saw this thing in the news. Democrats want electric cars. Republicans don't. Right. I'm thinkin' how crazy is it that we got a car debate goin' on in a city known for gridlock? UmLet's not talk politics in the office, okay? I like you better as the funny guy. I wasn't taking a a position. It was just sort of one of those things. Now, that's funny. That's funny. You walk much? Yeah! Right? I meanAh! Little click. Mm-hmm. D'Angelo, this box came for you.

I still have to look at this stuff, guys, so So this is a ten-gallon hat? Yeah, you like that? Ten-gallon hat. Technically, it only holds about three quarts. Little factoid. Interesting. D'Angelo's great. I love the guy. But I'm not sure he's a good fit for the office. And also, I'm not sure if I love the guy. All right, see you later, girl. Hey, hey, hey. Naw, I'm good. Keep that.

Get a recommendation from Michael. That'll put you right on the short list for next time there's an opening. Can't you just use the recommendation you already have on file? What recommendation? From when he recommended me to replace him. I'm so I'm sorry, I never know how to act in these awkward-type situations. Best whale watching. Easily the west coast.
