If she starts having sex with me, I'll know for sure. That's for you. And I am right in assuming that Dwight is short for D-Money. Cause that's what I wrote on your Save-The-Date. You set a date? J-Money. Or should it be T-Money, for Tuna? Receptionist-Money. K-Money. What are you making? A knife. You're making a knife with a knife? You got a better way? You wanna talk about it? About what?

All right. After vous. Thank vous. What? I didn't forget my keys. I just didn't want to make out with you in front of the cameras. Do you think they can hear us? Not if we turn these dials all the way down. Now they can't hear us at all. Good. We're totally alone. Yes, that's correct. I need to cancel checks from 10,001 to 90,000. Great, they stole my laptop. Well, they stole my surge protector. How does that even compare? Oscar, I'm now going to be prone to surges. Oh my god. What happened? We were robbed last night. Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic 7-men job. Security tapes were stolen. Motives, financial. Or possibly vintage HP computer collectors. Hank down at security had clocked out. And that is all we have. Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. That wasn't us, right? You remembered to lock the doors? No, did you? Michael, I think this is our fault. Oh, no. No, my god! My god. So much for sex without consequences. You are such a dork! Shots! So apparently Pam went out last night and accidentally called my work phone at 3:00 in the morning. So I'm not drunk. I'm on minute six of this message. OK, I do not sound like that. You can take the girl out of Philly. Scranton. The future mother of my children. I never felt safe here. You're always safe with me.

Where are we going? I know she loves me. I am sure of it. She practically told me so. Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she picks you, great. If not, you can move on. Are you sure that's gonna work? It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much. Wait, this isn't our floor Dwight. How's everyone doing? My door is always open If anyone wants to talk. I don't want to talk. I want my laptop back. Nobody steals from Creed Bratton and gets away with it. The last person to do this disappeared. His name? Creed Bratton. We're gonna make everything all right. All right? Conference room, 15 minutes. To recoup their losses, I am planning a little charity auction. Where people from all over Scranton can come and bid on our goods and services. I'm calling it Crime Aid. It's like Farm Aid. But instead of farms fighting against aids, it is us fighting against our own poverty. I think it's a fun idea. Thank you. We could auction off things that we do for each other, like cleaning or tennis lessons. My sorority did it all the time. I'm gonna have to stop you right here. Was this a sorority that you didn't get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own? Move on, Michael. OK. Come on! Let's have an auction. Let's do this. We'll auction off people, like in the olden days. So, in order to recoup the value of items we liked, we have to spend more money on things we don't want. Who would ever come to this? I don't know. It could be any number of people. It could be a pedestrian. It could be an old person. It could be a lookie-loo. Or it could be a Bruce Springsteen fan what? Who said that? I did. Why did I say that? I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. There's a point there. But what is the point? I don't understand what he's saying. It seems a little shady. It seems a little foggy. Well, it's not a little foggy. There's really something going on. Do you need us for any of this? Do I? Michael scored the big ticket item. Springsteen tickets. The boss scored the boss. I think that's pretty boss. He knows how to get things. He got me. Sorry. Twice. Right? Listen to me close cause I'm only gonna say this once. You either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me. Or you can say goodbye to this. I think you have me confused with another person. I said I was only gonna say it once. You have until 6:14 P.M. 6:14. I heard you. Pump it up! Pump up the volume. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, Mr. Springsteen.
