I've already got the run and the bike thing down. I just need to learn how to swim. Come on,you in? No,no,i think a triathlon is pretty much something i can rule out. It just doesn't interest me. So it's a matter of interest. Good.Okay. It's not anything you would have ever done. Mm,i might have done it when i was younger, but now there are just other things that i'd rather be doing than running and jumping. Well,there's no jumping in a triathlon. You're thinking the broad jump. Would you try Bungee jumping? No. Snowboarding? No,no. You want to go snowboarding? I might. Michael,what are you talking about? Nothing. Just life and Doing things Before you die. I don't know. Do i really want to go snowboarding? No. But i-- i would like to if i wanted to. What's going on in here? Andy bought lunch. Oh,no,really? Took a page right out of the old schrute book of niceness. There is no book.There's only a survival guide. You bought breakfast for everyone,so i got lunch for everyone. Okay,well,allow me. You know what-- gosh,these tacos are awfully complicated to make. I will make everyone's tacos. So we should get the check? What about your gift,michael? Oh,no,no,no. No,it's stupid.You'd hate it.I hate it. I'm sure i won't. Yes,you will. He locked himself in his office all morning working on it. Oh,gimme!Look at this wrapping paper.

Toilet paper  a scrapbook of our first memories, by michael gary scott. For my girlfriend helene on your birthday.  that's just an arbitrary title. Okay,here's a penny. What's that from? Penny for your thoughts. It was from the wishing well at the mall. You threw it in,and i went back later,waded in,and i found it. That's amazing! It's not amazing at all. It's sort of weird that i went and did that. And now your wish won't come true,so that blows. A poem. Oh,that i plagiarized,i think.  i cannot go to school today said little peggy ann mckay,  is that shel silverstein? Yeah.  i have the measles and the mumps,a gash,a rash,and purple bumps, and my teacher's really mean-- happy birthday,i love you,helene.  that's really nice,michael. Well,i think it sucks. I think it's wonderful.Absolutely wonderful. Well,that's because you and i have very different taste. And you like lame things. It's a generational sort of gap between us. God,a scrapbook.

Oh,okay. Honestly,for a long time i thought i was going to grow old with holly. And then i met helene,and she is great. And she already knows and has done everything that i have ever wanted to do, and can tell me about it. But i think i want to do those things myself. The cake's really good. Oh,i know. I love it when they use butter-cream frosting. Finish your cake,helene. I want you to enjoy that cake because i have something terrible i need to tell you, and i want you to enjoy your cake before i tell you this terrible,terrible thing.
