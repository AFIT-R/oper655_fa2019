Pam? Yeah? Did you see Oprah yesterday? No, I didn't. I I'm going to be a father. What was Oprah about? Angelina Jolie was on. And she adopted a baby from Asia, and she said that it changed her life, and that really inspired me. So I want you to look into see how much a little Chinese baby would cost. That's a really big decision. I know. Maybe you should wait before you adopt. Well Or not adopt. Just do it, okay? Roy's sister looked into it and the application alone costs $1,000. Well, find out if there's a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay? You know, she also said the waiting list is, like, eight months. Eight months? Yeah. I don't even know if I want a baby in eight months. Probably won't. You know what, Pam? If in 10 years, I haven't had a baby and you haven't had a baby No, Michael. Twenty years. No, Michael. Thirty. Sure. It's a deal. All right, three pairs of pants. Three pairs of socks. Mmm-hmm. Three packs of condoms. Yes. Fun jeans. Right there. Sign. Per diem. Guess where I am going? I will give you a hint. It is a booze-fuelled sex romp where anything goes. You are correct, sir! I am headed to Philadelphia for the annual Northeastern Mid-Market Office Supply Convention. And Jim Halpert is going to be coming, which'll be fun. Poor little guy has been stuck working under Josh, the poor man's Michael Scott, as he is known around my condo. Don't be mad, it is a business trip. But I don't understand. It's for managers. Monkey, I am an ARM, Assistant Regional Manager. I know! It's I was just really hoping we could spend some time together. Are you still there? Yes, monkey. Don't  monkey  me! You can't wait to get out of here, ARM! In the Martin family, we like to say,  Looks like someone took the slow train from Philly.   That's code for  Check out the slut.   What is Why are there flies in here? Oh, my God! Are you so excited for tonight? I'm so excited. You guys are gonna click, I can feel it. So what are you wearing? This. You look so pretty. Thank you. Yes, I have a date. He's a cartoonist for the local paper, which is really neat, because I like to draw, too. I'm kind of nervous. I haven't been on a first date in nine years. Probably shouldn't broadcast that. Well, remember, no matter how much you may want to, do not sleep with him on the first date, it gives him all the power. Sleep with who? Whom? Whom? Whom? My neighbor, Alan. They're going on a date tonight. Oh, wow! Oh, my God, I have a great idea. You know what you should do? Be hilarious. Wear your wedding dress. It'd be a great icebreaker! And your veil. Yeah. Do it! I'll probably just wear this. Really? Okay, well, word of advice, unbutton that top button, let those things breathe. Any message you want me to relate to Jim? Um  Um,  okay. You got that? I got it. Write it down. I'll write it down. Um, um, um, um There's my girl. Noticed you handing out some shekels. How would one get on that train? That was per diem for Philadelphia.

Hey, Michael. Hey, Josh, how you doing? Pretty good, how you doing? Good to see you. There he is! There's the traitor. Traitor! Traitor! Come here, you. Come here! The The progidal My son returns! I was shocked when he told me he was transferring to Stamford. It's like with firemen, you don't leave your brothers behind. Even if you find out that there is a better fire in Connecticut. It's really good to see you, man. Yeah. Wow. I didn't expect that. It's good to see you, too. Oh, hey, how's it going up there? Have you made any sales yet? Yeah, sold about 40,000. Hey! Shut up, that's impossible. No, it's not, and I did, yeah. Well, I did it, too. You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key. So did you hear? What? Pam's back on the market again. Really? She's dating? If I weren't engaged, I would so hit that. So what kind of commissions you get up there? Oh, Dwight, I missed you so much. You're so immature. Listen, Michael, I heard you were a great salesman, and I just wanted to let you know that if our branch absorbs your branch, I'm gonna look for a place for you in Stamford. Oh, hey! Hey. Hey, Jan. We all checked in? Yes. Great. Let's dump our stuff and meet back down here in half an hour. Okay. Okay. Jan? Look, I think we need to set some ground rules. What are you talking about? The 800-pound gorilla in the room. Carole? I'm still dating her, so nothing can happen between us at the convention. Step away from me, Michael. Thank you for being so brave with all of this. Thank you. Alan's cartoon's so funny, right? And they're, like, so smart. I don't even know what they mean half the time. This party is gonna be awesome! I know! That is specifically why I chose a room close to the elevator. More foot traffic. Check it out. That is crooked. On that side. Wow. Hey, hey! That is a lot of liquor. Yeah. And a dartboard. Well, that's how we do it in Scranton, or did you forget? Ain't no party like a Scranton party 'cause a Scranton party don't stop! We should probably head on down, you know, hook up with Jan. Hey, well, we have time! One for the road, gentlemen?  A shot of Midori, perhaps?  Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke. There's this bartender in Stamford who You know what? You just had to be there. I wish I was! I love inside jokes. Love to be a part of one someday. We should Yeah! All right, see you guys down there. See you guys. All right. Change your mind, come back up.

All right, Jan just e-mailed me. She wants us to meet her up front. Yup! Yeah, she's up front. You don't have e-mail on your phone. I don't have to, I just know. Yes? Hello? No one just called you.

We can grab lunch with him tomorrow. Hey, Jan? Jan? Don't worry, I have got the tip. Whoa, Michael! Wow! Oh, my God, thank you! Hey, no problem. Was that your per diem? No, that was a different $100 bill. What have you generated, Michael? I have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening. What party? The party I'm having tonight in 308, obviously, you are invited. Michael, Jim and Josh are in meetings all day, and I am in and out of meetings. I I can't stay on top of you 24l7. You should order the most expensive thing on the menu. So he knows you're worth it. If you do that, you're gonna have to put out. Oh, yeah, you'll have to put out. Is there a key for a Jane Doe? Thank you. Any messages for 308? All right. Hey, hey, fellers. Michael! Hey, Michael! What's up? Well, Jim and I have a meeting with uni-ball in about 45 minutes, so we should probably go now.

I think it's talking and being friends, and Jim thinks it's moving to Connecticut and being best friends with Josh. Well Phooey on that. I'm done. I am not going to be speaking with him anymore. Whatevs. Long-distance relationships never work. That is so true. Ready? Okay, let me tell you what we're looking for. Great. Sorry, my meeting ran late. Really?

Do you like Cosmos? Yeah, sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy? Michael I get it! Did I do something or No. No, I totally get it! He made a better paper airplane, Stamford does better in sales. You I get it, we had some fun. We had some laughs Wait, wait, wait. I didn't transfer because of you. You're a good boss. You're a great boss. I'm not better than Josh. Michael, it's not about I transferred because of Pam. Oh, my God. You don't even know. She's single now. No, I I heard something about that.

Now we're friends. Best friends. Some people need dozens of friends to say,  Hey, look at me, I'm popular!  But not me. I'm very picky. I need three, maybe two. When you meet that someone special, you'll just know, because a real relationship, it can't be forced. It should just come about effortlessly. Now would you do me the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir? What are all those stains? Blood, urine, or semen. Oh, God, I hope it's urine.
