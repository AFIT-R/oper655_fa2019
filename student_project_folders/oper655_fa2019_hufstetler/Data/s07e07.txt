I know a lot of us have been feeling under the weather lately, it's that time of year and according to a study done by the University of Arizona, they discovered that your keyboards have hundreds of time more bacteria per square inch Than a toilet seat. That's true. That's true. I dated her mama. And you know what? Stop. One of the simplest ways to cut down On the spread of germs is to use something Called the vampire cough. Did you say vampire? Oh, no, it's just that, if a vampire had to cough, He would do it like this. [coughs.] Uh-huh, right, And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is In Transylvania? 'cause of the euro. Well, other things you can do To help cut down on the spread of disease Are to wash your hands regularly, Don't come in if you're sick, And get your flu shot. Also, I'm going to set up hand-sanitizing stations Around the office. No. No, no. They will cost you your life. Elaborate. The worst thing you can do for your immune system Is to coddle it. They need to fight their own battles. If Sabre really cared About our well-being, They would set up hand-desanitizing stations. A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, Fecal matter. I'm not going to do that. Exposing yourself to germs Is the best way to make yourself stronger. So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you. Yes. I would welcome it. [sneezes.] You're welcome. The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, Enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. [sneezes.] I don't know why everyone doesn't do this. Maybe they have something against living forever. [cheerful music.] Jim. Pam. And the precious bundle of God's best everything. I wish you both a pleasant day. And you too. Yes. Praise God. Okay. Cece's getting christened today. Big day. Everyone from work is here. We weren't planning on that. Nope. Top o' the Sunday morning to you. And a top o' the day to you too, sir.

It is about us all. And I thought we should all celebrate My joy and our all of our joys. Ah, man. Does the nard dog want nard pups? Yeah. I want a big old litter of nard pups, All jumping around and sucking on the teat. Put 'em in a box, give 'em to my neighbors. Yeah, I want kids. For all your paper and printer needs.

[imitating Marlon Brando.] hey. Hey. I got an offer that you can't refuse. Scooch over. Oh, Michael, this is just for family. But I'm the godfather.

Scooch, Before I shoot you in the head. Okay, Michael, um, You know I love when you do that voice, But today, I'm so sorry, Need you to tell me that you know You're not Cece's godfather. Yeah.

You don't know them all? Nope, and we're gonna need A loaves and fishes kind of miracle To feed 'em all. Jesus is not your caterer. But he should be your caterer, 'cause you're a little angel. Why didn't your parents get you a caterer? They don't think. Hmm. Don't listen to her. She's just jealous 'cause she doesn't get to come home To someone as cute as you.

Shh. Right now, Jessica's children Have to walk 12 miles to a school with dirt floors. No. It's gonna be three months of hard work, And when we're done, we'll practically be Quimixtanos.

Are you kidding me? Stop it. I'll call you back. My parents explained it to me this way.

What if the moon was your car And Jupiter was your hair brush? Shh. Thank you. Or should I say gracias? [applause.] [sighs.] Cece went down. What was this? You're out of it. Scones. I didn't get one.

You want some more of this? Look at these people. These are church-going people. And they know how to party. Church isn't a party, Michael. Well, it's it's welcome to the party. Everybody have their kool-aid? No. Okay, you know what? This is inappropriate. What is wrong with you guys? What is wrong with you? What is so horrible about wanting to get together And do something nice? Why did you guys even come today? What's so great about your lives that you think You're better than everybody else? That you can make fun of everybody else? You're mean. You're mean girls. Like the movie mean girls.

Okay, there is no off-season when it comes to printer sales. You know what, my job will be here when I get back. Michael, you can't go to Mexico. You don't have your passport. You don't need one to get in. Plus, we can just have it sent to him down in Mexico. Hey, right? Michael, what am I supposed To tell my clients if they ask about you? Tell them that I died And I turned into an angel, And, when they feel a breeze In a room with all the windows closed Or that that chill on the back of their neck, That is just me watching over them. Okay, but what about the bigger corporate accounts? Tell them that I'm in a meeting. Michael, I am just about to close a sale. Can I authorize a 15% discount? No, you may not. Gah! I think it's really cool, Michael. I wish I had a job that I could just leave. Thank you. Save me an aisle seat, Michael! I'm coming! I will not stand idly by While these Mexican villagers are sick. We're actually building 'em a school. Whatever. I won't I won't stand for it. See you in a few months. If the whole world were like you guys, We wouldn't have so many problems. Mm. That's not gonna happen. We're one in a million. I know. Nobody I know would leave their jobs And friends and families To do manual labor for three months. Well, you know what, everybody thinks that I am crazy, And that tells me that I am the sanest person I know. So Just a heads up. Probably gonna be borrowing a few things. Gonna need a contact lens case, Some sunscreen, some sandals Why you always got to be so mean to me? Uh, meemaw, where's Cece? I don't know. I lost the purse too. Okay. Good-bye, Lackawanna county. How long till we get to Mexico? Well, two days minus how long we've been on the road. So, like, two days basically. Maybe more. Ooh. What are we building down there again? Like, a hospital? A school for Mexicans? What? I don't know, I thought it was like a gymnasium or Why aren't they building it themselves? They don't know how. Do we know how? I don't know how. Well, Carla knows. You know how? Carla knows. Oh, I feel like there were so many more people on this bus. There were, like, Hey, Carla? Carla? Hi. What are you doing? Oh, trying to sleep. What is happening?

Really love to check out the view. Can't stop. We're on a schedule. Well, there's a nice bistro coming up. We could pick up some Paninis for the road. Maybe we'll stop in Tennessee.
