D,  brushing his teeth! $250 is more money than i've ever seen in my life. I will say  c,  a gun. He shot himself in the head. That is correct! Yes! I usually don't enjoy the theater. But this is delightful. The economic downturn has been difficult recently, Forcing the closures of both camden and yonkers, To be followed soon By what other branch? For $500,000, Is it,  a,  scranton?  B,  buffalo?  C,  utica? What? Or  d,  toothbrush? I will say  b,  buffalo! Final answer! That is correct! What is he talking about? How did you know that? David wallace told me! David, is this true? Okay, everyone, we're at a picnic today. Are we losing our jobs or not, david? They didn't know? I guess not. I'm sorry, this certainly wasn't the time or the place To announce thisort of thing. But there have been talks about closing the buffalo branch. And we're-- We're closing the buffalo branch. You've gotta be kidding me! Are you serious? You've gotta be kidding me! We're the best branch in the company! I can't believe it. How could you possibly think That the right way to announce a branch closing Was in a comedy sketch at the company picnic? Welli didn't know they didn't know. What about the fact that they're here today? What about that? That didn't throw up any alarms? No, michael need a little bit for his comedy sketch, And he thought,  oh, this would be really funny.  Thank you. Damn it, michael. I told you that in confidence. Now i have to go over and deal with these employees And their families. A little boy just walked up to me and said,  Is my daddy gonna have a job by christmas?  Well, he'ju thinking about his own gifts. Maybe we shouldn't play due to the circumstances. Hey, people need volleyball now more than ever. How do you figure? Because if we don't play, Then the other team wins. Dwight's right. Corporate deserves to get its ass kicked. Let's do this. Jim, come on! Look who just woke up! Uhh! I been up for a while! It's six to six. It's a nail-Biter. kav   Seven Now it's seven-Six. Or is that too much accounting for you? Here's an accounting question for you. What does one fiance plus one lover equal? ?? One whore. Okay, knock it off, rolph. What? She's sitting there, casting aspersions-- Rolph, please. I am asking nicely! Rolph, leave it alone! ??? There you go. You got it. ??? Boo-Yah! Get it! I got it! Pam! You all right? Yeah. No, no, no, i'm fine. You sure? Yeah. easy??? Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. You wanna get that looked at. No, no, it's fine. Just give me a second. I don't know. You know, this is a company picnic, So, technically, that is a company injury. You know, safest thing to do is get that examined. Right, david? Yeah. All right, you know what? You're justrying to get rid of our best player. Oh, jim, you're putting a volleyball game In front of your fiancee's health. No, uh-- Look, seriously. I can move it fine. Come on, let's go. It's our ball. Let's go! I don't kw. Yeah, i don't think we can let you play with that foot. Come on. Tell you what. I spotted a small hospital A few kilometers south of here. Get her back as soon as possible. I'll stall 'em. I guess that's it for you, jim. All right, you know what? ???Come on, all-Black. We'll be back! Oh, man! I'm so mad that pam got hurt! Argh! Rrrah! I'll get it. Probably shouldn't ve mentioned buffalo. Hindsight. Should have had hindsight. How do you think it went before the buffalo thing? I think it went well. I think it was good. There weren't any laughs. No, it was a tough audience. Yeah, but we wrote it Specifically for this audience. Believe me, I have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, And that was one of them. Well, i'm glad we did it. Me too. We have a lot of good material For next year's sketch. I can't wait. Yeah, she's with the nurse right now, So you'll have to stall No, don't send in the subs yet. Dwight, i don't know. Think of something. Well, to be safe, we should do an x-Ray. How long will that take? Oh, it shouldn't be too bad. It's a slow day. So no other radiation this year? No metal plates? No chance you're pregnant? I'm sorry, could we just hurry this up? I' got a game to get back to. Oh, good, because my next question was Do you have a game to get back to? What'd you think? I loved it. You know, there was a part near the end That seemed like that went on a little long. But well, you guys should hit the road before i close down another branch. Okay. So good to see you. Good to see you. Aj. Michael. I didn't find the perfect moment, Because i think that today Was about just having today. And i think that we are one of those couples With a long story When people ask how we found each other. I will see her every now and then. And maybe one year, she'll be with somebody, And the i'll be with somebody. And it's gonna take a long time and then it's perfect. I'm in no rush. Ha! Dwight, come on, now. It's time to put in the subs. Yeah, it looks like pam won't make it back. Okay? Okay, fine. All right! Come on. Except, you know what? It's not fine. How many people need to get hurt Before we learn a valuable lesson? One? Two? Three? Four? Dwight no, no, hear me out. Five? Six? Dwight. Seven. Can i finish, please? Okay. Eight? ???H, dwight, we're so close. Just buy us a few more minutes. Well, they just called me in for an updat So i'll call you right back. ?? Hey, dwight, uh send in the subs. Ohh.
