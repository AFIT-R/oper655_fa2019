Merry christmas. Good. My diabolical plot is on hold for christmas. My heart just melts with the sound of children singing. Not really. I'm just tired. The days are short. I don't know. Maybe I'm depressed. It is time to unveil the tree. Hey, rockefeller center. Yeah. Uh, I've actually been to rock center, And this is nothing like that. This is all we have. Ugh. Nope, it's not  ugh.  It is office camaraderie. It is warm feelings. Why don't we talk more about it instead of doing it? 30, 29, 28 Why would you start so high? 27 3, 2, 1 26 Ooh. Ah. You didn't decorate it. No, exactly. We didn't, because we think It would be better to do it together. Everyone. Why would you wrap it in a sheet If you're not covering anything up? Is--is it fake? Pam. Yes! We are unveiling an artificial tree. That will never die Yes. Like the spirit of christmas. And we're supposed to applaud you For you taking a giant diaper off a fake tree? This was a successful unveiling. Go back to work! Merry christmas. Hello. Sorry, guys. Sorry, guys. I'm not sure I've earned the right To make announcements yet, But whoever is giving me the twelve days of christmas As my secret santa, Please stop. I can't take it anymore. My cat killed a turtledove. The french hens have started pulling out my hair To make a nest. Please stop. What psycho would send that as a gift? I begged dwight and jim To give me erin for secret santa. And I decided to give erin the twelve days of christmas. Bowtie time. Is it my fault that the first eight days There's basically Ho, ho, ho! Merry christmas, boys and girls. It's me, santa claus. Hey, santa. They finally let you do it. Congrats, phyl. It's so edgy. I have been wanting to be santa for years. I believe I have the right temperament And the figure to do the job well. I slipped a note to jim And he said I could do it. ohIt's been a long journey But I'm santa claus! So, santa, what can we expect from this party? It's going to be a very jolly time If you've been good. What if you've been bad? Oh, then nothing but a lump of coal for you. What if you've been really, really bad? More  evil  than strictly  wrong.  Hey, creed, we covered it. Lump of coal. For the past several weeks, My secret santa has been giving me pieces of a machine That I've been attempting to assemble. I'm suspicious of this, Because I had the exact same idea For catching osama bin laden. I would simply send him a different piece each day. He would assemble it To find himself In jail! You know, oscar, every time I make this lasagna, People ask me if it's a family recipe. But reallyI just get the recipe from the box. That's funny. Is it funny? I thought it was more Interesting than funny. I think my water just broke. That's too funny. Oscar and the warehouse guy. Go, oscar! Go, gay warehouse guy! Here'sSanta!

I'm not gonna go tell phyllis that she can't be santa. Fine. Then do it anonymously. Ransom note style. You can You know what? I have a bunch of letters cut out of magazines in my desk. You can use those. If this were russia, yeah. Sure, everybody would go to one santa. And there would be a line around the block, And once you sat on her lap And she asked you what you wanted, You would say, probably,  freedom  At which point the kgb would arrest you And send you to siberia. It's a good thing russia doesn't exist anymore. Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho! Why pay more to sit next to old tranny claus over there When you can sit on my lap? Phyllis is only pretending to be a man. I'm the real thing! Sit down on my lap, and there will be no doubt! No, it's not, like, penis-wise. Hello, little boy! What's your name? Michael, it's me, kevin. Phyllis says I'm too big for her lap.
