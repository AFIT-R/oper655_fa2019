I have gotten quotes from suppliers. I have sent out an e-Vite for our big, Grand-Opening pancake luncheon. Six yeses, one maybe, only 11 nos. and 788 not yet replieds. But of that group, 782 have viewed it. I'm going to need ??Coupon for unparalleled customer service. I make that one copy And i become the girl who makes copies. And by the end of the day i'm receptionist again. And the worst part is, i like making copies. The paper comes out all warm and stuff. And it's cold in there, 'cause it's technically a closet.

A woman was murdered on this very floor in 1816. Haddie mcgonagle. she was a prostitute. Why was she in this building? No, this whole place used to be a brothel. There was a tavern on the ground floor. That's crazy. Yeah, isn't it? She was bludgeoned to death By the business end of a riding crop. Oh, my god. It was gruesome. They say she walks these hallways. If you ever feel a tapping on your shoulder, That could be haddie, begging for her life. And it could mean that you're next. Just kidding. You finding everything okay? Yeah. Yeah? Got some ice. Oh, this is awkward. So i'll see you guys around. ??Buddy. Hey, ryan, could you get to that copy from before? ??Ter at that stuf that is so insulting. How is it insulting to say that you're good at something? Because the thing that you're saying i'm good at Is pushing a big green button a bunch of times. I'm not judging it. It's like I could run gm, but i couldn't fix a car. It's not saying that one is better than the other. Seriously? 'Cause it sounds like one of those Is better than the other. what the hell?! Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen! I need somebody to make a copy of this! Because i don't make copies. I'm the boss. Got it? I make originals. Yeah, i make originals too. Shut up. stop it!

This is what's so important, Putting naked pictures on the desktop. That's me and my friend jasmine, from thailand. I don't want to look at your friend jasmine's boobs all day. You could be hot too if you made any effort at all. Like how? Dying my hair blonde? This is from the sun. Oh, yeah, i bet. They're getting on my nerves, mom. Both of them.

Just ??N up. It has come to my attention that some people in this office Are not getting along with other people in this office. And i think i have come up with the reason why. This office space is too small. Definitely. Okay. There are four corners in this room. Each corner is to be a personal space For each one of you. Whichever corner you want. And make it your own.

Use it in a sentence. can you get this rundown for me? Try another sentence. This rundown better be really good. I don't know. But it sounds like the rundown is really important. Charles asked me to do this rundown Of all my clients. Why don't you just ask him-- No, i can't. It was, like, hours ago. What have you been doing? Try another sentence. Last night was crazy. Jojo yeah. He did a doughnut in the parking lot In front of a cop. And then he yells,  hey, cop, you like doughnuts?  Then we drive off. ??Noust stayed there. I want that new phone. No, the other one. No, the other one. No, you know which one i'm talking about. It's the one-- No, the one with the awesome browser. no, not that one. that's my corner.
